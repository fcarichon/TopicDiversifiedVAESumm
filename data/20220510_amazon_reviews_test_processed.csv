CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"this is the ultimate christmas album in my house ! i grew up with this album and many others being played everyday between thanksgiving and christmas ! just hearing the first few notes takes me back 25 - 30 years easily ! i turned my husband on to mr. goulet some 10 years ago and now he and our 3 children love it too ! a must have ! i just got the ad last year after much searching . i still have the original album , but the kids can not understand why you can not jump up and down while listening to an album , besides it is nice to have this one to listen to in the van !",108,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"this is the type of album they do not make anymore , classic christmas songs both religous and secular with great arrangements and orchestrations . goblets version of pants angelicos is breathtaking . i have dozens of really great christmas albums mathis , williams , crosby and this album takes it is place right alongside those . if you like the idea of an old fashioned christmas you will love this album .",63,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"again 20 words , whew . the songs are few , knew this . i did not expect reverberation to be used . if i want to hear reverberation , i would buy a reverb amplifier . sent quickly to me . excelent results , no damage to case or disc .",41,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"i bought this ad for that one song alone ! my parents had a compilation up now in my collection that included barbra streisand , julie andrews , and many other incredible singers . i think it was a giveaway at christmas at the firestone tire store i no i am not kidding i and the most incredible thing on that whole album was robert goulet singing pants angelicos . i had never heard the song before , do not know latin . but oh my god i picked it up on ebay a few days ago . there were 3 - 4 other copies available . while i do have that vinyl up , and enjoy all of the other songs and singers on it , this is the one i need on ad format so i can carry it some amounted it into my computer , include it in my own christmas playlists . i am looking forward to the other material on the ad , but all i need is pants angelicos . obviously , for me this is the definitive rendition of this beautiful song .",168,11

Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"i am sad that i did not read it long ago . it turns out i have had it on my kindle for quite a while . i loved it ! i love all of farrah books but it was good to read masons story as i would read kieran story first . i love the maplesville and gather , la series as well as all of her other books and will continue to read her stories .",69,0
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"i enjoyed the second installment of the maplesville series . it is short , but feels like a regular book . i enjoyed reading about jada and mason , who are enemies that find they have some naughty things in common . i can not wait until the next installment .",43,1
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"this is the second installment from farrah reckons moments in maplesville series . a little bit naughty is jada dangerfields story . her knight in shining armor is mason coleman , her nemesis throughout high school and the older brother of her best friend kiera . i love jada and masons story and their oil and water relationship . so happy they found love in the end . a short read , but very enjoyable . a must purchase .",71,2
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"i really like this book . the plot was well fleshed out . jada and mason had been antagonizing one another since high school . he has more straight laced than she . unbeknownst to her , he has always been interested in her but had his reasons for keeping his distance and acting hostile toward her . usually , when that is the scenario , i find that the reasons are ridiculous . however , in this case , i did not find his reasons to be ridiculous . i liked the fact that even although jada was not as straight laced as mason , she was not over the top bohemian flighty either . she was actually pretty grounded . anyway , i like how the story and the relationship progressed . there was no jumping into bed two chapters in . i will read this author again .",128,3
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,this was a sweet book that reminded me that there are still some knights in shining armor in the world .,20,4
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,great story . being from louisiana i almost googled to see if any of those small towns are real ! loved the chemistry between the leads well developed characters .,27,5
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,i enjoyed this continuation of the maplesville series . jada and mason were able to begin a relationship that mason had dreamed about since high school . ms. cochon in did an excellent job in writing this book . i look forward to book3 .,41,6
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,this is the second book i have read by this author and i really enjoyed it . i look forward to reading more of her books .,24,7
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"i fell in love with these characters and the author did a great job moving the story along . i am not a big review person so i pretty much keep things short . when i do not feel as if i have hit a snag in a story , it gets 5 stars .",48,8
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,who would have thought mason would be a closet freak ? way to go ms. cochon keep up the good work .,20,9
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,please let there be more to jada and mason i story ! ? i would love to read more about them and see where their relationship goes .,25,10
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,this latest novella from farrah cochon was great . i could not put it down once i started reading it last night . the chemistry between mason and jada was hot . can not wait until the next novella in this series .,37,11
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,i enjoyed this book . the fact that the love making was sweet and sexy made me look forward to each session . i also enjoyed the fact that masons biggest sin was trying trying to take care of the women in his life .,42,12
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"jada and mason appear to be public enemy 1 but they say it is a thin line . find how true that is in this romantic tale . mason has had the hots for jada for years but like little boys does not how to express it . so , of course jada thinks the worst of him . when they clash of her naughty business , sparks begin to fly !",63,13
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"i love farrah cochon and i always forget until i pick up one of her books and am left speechless . this little diddy went above and beyond my expectations . mason and judas relationship was fire , flawed and going to last forever . my favorite kind of romances are love or hate and unrequited love and this was both in one . everyone needs to invest in this book . it is a quick read , realistic and oh so kinky ! can not wait for the next installment !",79,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,great quality but the album it is self is kinda eh,10,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"with this band you kinda of know what you are going to get . it is not absolutely ground breaking , but it follows a simple formula . there has always that 3 doors down sound thrown in . it is a good album , but i feel like all their albums are starting to sound similiar . this could be my last album from them that i buy . that is not to say they have a bad album because they do not . plus their packaging is always cool .",78,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"i am a writer , so music is a necessity for me . listening to differing types of music helps me to set the mood for different scenesrock music for action scenes , and more upon looking at some mp3 albums on here , i had the thought to look for 3 doors down , seeing as i have always enjoyed their music . so far , this is my favorite album by them . , i was bobbing my head from the title track time of my life all the way to the end . i am addicted to more than one song on the album , and now listen to it every day . seriously glad i found this one , and for some amount of money i think it is way worth it . do not pass this album up !",123,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"i have been a fan of 3 doors down for many years , and i like all of their past albums 5/5 stars , but this time is different for time of my life , this album disappoints me just a little bit . i rate this album 4/5 stars , because there is not one song i really connect to like i have on their previous albums . i know every band evolves after so long , but did they pick the right time to do it , this many years in their career ? i personally think they are starting to sound more mainstream , and i do not like that much . time of my life is a bit of a change from their previous albums , this album is softer than their previous albums . i do not think this time around , that this album was worth the 3 year wait . this album is still good , but not great like their other albums .",148,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"i have been a 3 doors down fan from the first album . if you have been also then you will not be dissapointed nor surprised by this offering . the formula is there and add does not break from it very much . it is just a good rock album as all of them have been . i doubt that the fan base will expand because of this album but they certainly will not lose any fans over it . these guys have settled into their comfort zone long ago and know what they are doing and seem to have fun doing it . simply put , if you have bought their past albums then buy this one . if you are not a fan and know little about this band , i suggest picking up their first album which has the hit superman on it and give it shot . you will probably be hooked and start buying the rest in short order .",152,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,i really liked all their previous cos but i just can not connect with this one . there is not even one exceptional song and the overall tone strikes me as having a country or redneck flavor that does not appeal to me . i am disappointed because i actually liked the last ad better than the previous one so i was not expecting such a drop - off .,61,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"this is truly a great ad with great acoustics and lyrics they give a top performance with no exceptions . if you like them , you will like this .",27,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,one of their best yet . i highly recommend this to fans of this genre . it is awesome and i loved every song .,21,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"here you have 3 doors down with their new ad and let me tell you it is one of their best ! it is an album you have to listen to a few times and then you know what i am talking about ! real great stuff and everyday i have a new favorite just like believer , round and round and then there has heaven just great . but this is just my review and i am a big fan from holland and i love those guys to death . my least favorite is race for the sun but after 01:40 i love the song . it is just a matter of taste but i recommend it to everyone who loves great music without the reviews of some sites !",118,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"i love three doors down but honestly only one song stands out on this ad , yup you guessed it , when you are young and while it is a good song i can only take so much . all the rest of the songs blend in together and i was pretty much disappointed for how much i payed for this come amounts just say i expected much more and maybe a few heavier songs in the mix .",73,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,this band has been putting out stellar stuff but have to stay this one is just ok . there is the same old same old and some new vibes songs going on here .,32,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"i have come to respect this band a lot . they deliver some of the best melodic rock available nowadays , along with incubus . this is a very good album that represents it is maturity and evolution since the kryptonite days , following the here without you breakthrough .",43,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"3 doors down is by far my favorite band , and this album does not change that . this album , just like every one they have put out , is just as good as the the last ! this album is exceptional . the songs on it give you such a great feeling , with a different feeling with each song . my favorites would have to be heaven , what has left , and round and round , but every song on this album is awesome ! five out of five stars without a doubt ! love it ! also , the bonus did is fantastic ! it includes i think four songs from time of my life as well as kryptonite , away from the sun , and let me be myself . it is pretty awesome ! great purchase and you will love it !",125,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,this is a great ad just a good rock di do not see how you can not like this one,21,13

Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"a quick read with characters it is easy to care about , this story is perfect for a lunch or midweek evening entertainment choice . no explicit sex whatsoever . as a short romance , in which the characters need to get to the hea in very few pages , the story holds it is own . well edited and written . recommended .",54,3
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"it is christmas time and i am so busy , but can not put my kindle down . this is the perfect short story . a romance with just a little suspense for the holidays . it is a cute short story so you can get it read and onto all the other stuff that needs to be done . i hate for a book to end , so i did think it could have been a little longer .",70,4
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"cute story but without a great deal of substance . would liked to have seen a longer , more involved story . otherwise , okay .",21,5
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"what a fun book . very enjoyable , will keep an eye out for this author . loved the characters , dogs and christmas setting",21,6
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"expected a sweet christmas story but found a shallow tale with limited believability . the storyline had potential . it would have made a great detective novel , only the juicy details were bunched up at the end like an after thought . next christmas i expect more excitement from this author .",48,7
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"this was a quick read , but very enjoyable . nina kept a light tone overall even although the criminal was of the most despicable sort . the characters both human and canine were very likable .",33,8
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"this short feature was full of favorite things : santa , dogs , cops and love . throw in a frustrating mystery case and characters who actually get out of their heads and attempt to communicate with each other eventually , make this one a keeper . it was really a fun read .",47,9

Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"this was a cute christmas novella about a girl , dogs , a cop and santa claus . a perfect story for the holidays !",21,12
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"nice , short story . both characters were likeable . their pets were equally or more entertaining , and cute . i loved how the heroine is able to help the hero with his investigation at the end . i would have liked the story to have taken longer than it did for the characters to get to know each other . it seemed too sudden .",59,13
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,a light holiday reading it was certainly worth the price . i would pick up another book by this author,21,14
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"this is a fun read , keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next and how will the characters get out of their latest problem . seriously , this is a tense , taut thriller that is not filled with blood and gore , at least not too much , just enough . the author makes you feel the characters stress . it is not overly complicated and you might wonder why some of the characters bad decisions are not more obvious to them . but it is an interesting page turner . try it , you will like it .",92,0
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"for a stand - alone novel , this book had a horrible ending . if it had not been on my kindle , i would have thrown the book across the room . i feel that the story is incomplete and waiting for a sequel , but there is no sequel to this story . the only reason i gave it 3 stars was due to the action packed read , even although you have to get one - third of the way through before the action grips you . once you reach that part , the book is difficult to put down . then the ending leaves you with multiple loose ends that will never be resolved .",104,1
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"great read ! lots of action , well written great adventure story ! i had a hard time putting the book down ! it leaves the end open for a sequel and i hope there will be one .",34,2
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,book dragged for most of story and then ended suddenly . the final paragraph simply stopped the story in mid event as if the author simply gave up too tired to finish . that or he had a heart attack in mid sentence and someone else wrote the end .,47,3
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,i struggled to maintain enthusiasm for this book . the characters were pretty one dimensional and failed to garner my sympathies . the author clearly set this up for a sequel leaving me unsatisfied at the end .,35,4
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,this author loves to stop a book in the middle of a although . i would suggest like his last series to wait until this series is completed before you start reading the books . if you doing you will only be frustrated .,41,5
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"sorry but did not like this book at all . characters are one dimensional , the dialogue is stilted and character interactions are predictable . this could have used more editing .",27,6
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"too many unanswered questions . too many unanswered questions . just when you think you are going to find out what happens with the main characters , you get a big the end . hate i spent money on this !",36,7
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,i enjoyed this book . it is a very good archaeological under the sea mystery . j.t. cross has written another exceptional fast paced story that keeps you up late into the night .,31,8
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"fun read that draws you in quickly . a bit far fetched and some of the central themes of the book are never brought full circle . but , it is still an entertaining read that is hard to put down at times . i would recommend and i will look for more it cross going forward .",53,9
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,i could not put the book down from the beginning to end . it was captivating and full of suspense . great read !,21,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,we bought this ad because we just love the song i need you to survive . we used to sing it in one of our previous congregations and wanted to introduce it to the our current congregation . the song moves us to want to be better in our relationships and reminds us just how important each of our brothers and sisters are to us .,63,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,i absolutely love my ad . i was going through some difficult times and was looking for a particular song and on this ad i found many songs that uplifts me daily .,31,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,it is okay but i was expecting much much more . i was disappointed in most of the songs on this album . i just could not get into all of them at all .,31,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,i love this choir and discovered them on their last release several years ago and made it a point to purchase all of their previous recordings . i am a baby boomer and think that their ministry is anointed and that their songs are theologically sound and touch the soul . i love their church as well !,54,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"i had never heard of emily barker and the red clay halo but i heard the theme song while watching the wallander series on pas and wondered who was performing that haunting song . so i checked out the music credits and found emily barker . i began sampling her songs through amazon.com and other websites . i found her albums are not available in the states at a reasonable price but found a used album through the amazon marketplace . i must say i love every track on this album , especially nostalgia , disappear and oh journey . the lyrics and the music make a distinct blend that is creative and fresh . these songs stay in my mind and i find myself humming them at odd moments . if you like folk or country you really need to check out emily barker .",133,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"this was not what i expected . i felt that by listening to the song nostalgia , this would be more folk or folk rock , but it seems to be more of the country bent . however , she is very talented , i do enjoy this ad would purchase more by this artist .",51,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"i was not familiar with emily barkers music other than wallander so i did not really know what to expect . after listening to snow , i can say that i am still not all that knowledgeable of her overall sound but she is most definitely talented , clear of voice and one he shall of a song writer or musician . this is not the type of music that i , personallysome amountisten to until i am tired of , but rather will re - visit at various times when i either need a break from my normal listening habits or when i re - discover this album as i shuffle through my play list .",98,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,i found this music because of the author henning cancel . his books about the detective kurt calendar have been so good . i saw that the bac has made a film of one of the books starring kenneth branch . it was filmed in sweden but everyone had a british accent . funny . the film was really good and followed the book closely . at the end of the film an interview with henning cancel was included . he talked about the renaissance of art in scandinavian and got me started on going deeper into the genre . the music for this wonderful film included this group and i liked the theme so i ordered the ad . i have listened to it over and over and it is now one of the albums i can sing along with in the car . i will buy another .,139,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"when i first heard this music as the theme song on the kurt wallander bac movies , i knew i wanted to hear more . i was not disappointed . often only one song is a real winner , not so with emily ad . every song flows effortlessly to the next and none break the mood . everyone i have played this for has been impressed . i even shared it with some of my friends from the phil folk festival staff , who were equally impressed . maybe a us concert appearance is in your future ?",89,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"not an easy album to find , but the haunting music will transport you . the singer has a unique voice and the songs are unusual .",24,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,the best thing about this album is the theme from wallander . the rest of the ad is a lovely blue grassy feel .,22,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,great . found this after watching wallander on the to . great series . the ad is really good . i have also ordered a few more from the band .,27,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"covered and cambrian are truly an amazing band . their style is considered emo , something that i am not too fond of . but this band is different . claudio sanchez is a master vocalist , with high pitch squeals to low end thunder drama that sends chills down anyones neck . his guitar riffs are odd , yet surprisingly catchy . the lyrics tell a story of wassome amountove , murder , and mystery . joshua upwards drum chops bring the songs to life , with amazing dynamical refuge that seize every moment of this record . the technical difficulty of travis steers guitar sound speak for itself , and michael todd brings it home with bass lines that will send even jonathan ruth to the principals office . in keeping secrets of silent earth:3 showcases their wonderful talents and provides professional rock anthems that will send your heart pounding with excitement . i recomend this album to anyone who is into rush , led zeppelin , the flaming lips , the used , or any good rock music . very well done .",164,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"i first heard about these guys from my cousin . he told me , you should listen to these guys . they sound like rush , only better . so one day , after being bored with what mainstream rock was feeding me , i gave my cousin a call and asked the name of that band . little did i know , after that phone call , that covered and cambrian would soon be my new favorite band . at first when i heard coca associated with the term emo , i thought about a bunch of whiny guys singing depressing music . boy was i wrong . you need to own both of cocks cos second stage turbine blade is the 1st i believe because they are both awesome . covered and cambrian are really skilled musical artists that do not get enough attention , although they are now starting to get more mainstream , whether you think that is a good thing or not i will leave up to you . i can not wait for their next ad coming out later this year . i will definitely buy it and will definitely see these guys live . this is truly an amazing ad , i recommend you buy it today ! today already , what are you waiting for ?",196,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"i have heard this album in my friends car a dozen times he loves it . i find it unbearable . most of the songs have no discernible melody , or drive , or genuine emotion . i hate this album for the same reason i hate modern rob music . there is no real passion in the singing or songwriting , only a grand display of pretentious melodrama . yuck . listen to a band with actual songwriting skillssome amounting guided by voices or the beatles .",75,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"where do i start with this album ? most people put this under the categories of punk rock . well , honestly , i hate punk rock beyond belief . this is nothing like punk . for one thing , it is an album that makes you actually think about the lyrics . for another thing , sure the lead singer does have that weird hair and beard , but at least he has not one of thoes punk or emo posers that have no talent . if i could , i would give this album ten stars out of five . so , overall , if you like to hear music that has a lot of thought in it , buy this album !",104,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"bad songs , bad album . although i do own all 4 of there albums , this is garbage . the band seemed to go in a different direction of sound compared to albums 1,2 4 . get there 2nd album the second stage turbine blade there 1st album the penelope ep if you can find it ! the 4th album good apollo , i am burning star , volume one : from fear through the eyes of madness is amazing too !",74,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"a great ad . covered never seems to stick to one particular style , a good thing . the vocals have an amazing range and no one song sounds similar to the other . first song recommendations would be 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 . not very good at remembering names , sorry . this band has no limits and could end up anywhere they want . also try glassjaw or thrice .",62,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"this is the first time i have written a review , but this band has compelled me to do so . i have been a coheedcambria listener since a few weeks after they released second stage turbine blade . i was a big fan then , but with the release of in keeping secrets of silent earth:3 , i simply can not contain my enthusiasm for these guys any longer . coheedcambria paint a sinister epic saga through their songs . the lyrics are vivid , yet leave much to the imagination of the listener . the band has honed their sound and put together what i consider a breath of very fresh air in todays pop - driven manufactured - music scene . kudos to coheedcambria for simply writing the music they love to write , because i love to listen to it ! may the next installment of the saga be as groundbreaking as the last two !",141,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,this album was not bad could have been better but considering the last kiss album in the 1970s with the make up on their faces the album closed off a decade that kiss ruled along with the stones and aerosmith .,39,2

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"aces solos on 2000 man hard times make this a must have for any kiss fan . yes the lead song i was made for lovin you has a disco beat , but it is a great song ; and again , ace let us it rip on a great solo . peter criss is pictured on the cover , but does not play on the album . anton fig of david letterman band handles the drum work . because of peters absence , technically you can not consider this a kiss record . but setting that point aside , dynasty is the last great record kiss ever made . it is the great song writing and aces signature guitar that defines kiss for me ; and this is the last kiss album where ace really shines .",121,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"after licking their wounds from the solo disasters , kiss came back with dynasty . but this was not really a comeback as much as it was an unstable atom trying hard not to fracture . it kicks off with three rapid fire shots then falls apart quick . i was made for loving you was pop disco as only kiss could have imagined it , and compared to most dance tracks fron that era , holds up rather well . aces reading of the stones 2000 man was probably his best moment on record as a singer . finally , sure know something was a great single that somehow got lost in the backlash that had formed around kiss . unfortunately the rest of the album gasses out from here . history tells us that internal strife and excess was beginning to tear the band apart by now ; listening to dynasty with that backstory behind it hints at why the remainder of the record sounds so uninspired . great cover although . i had that poster on the wall although college !",168,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"i remember buying this album when i was in 8th grade . at the time , i was not sure how i felt about it . i remember that it gripped me in the back of my mind when i thought about it although . snap to 2007 ! the album i had back in the day had been long gone with maybe a few others that i loaned out and forgot about . i just bought the master on ad and after watching histology , i must say , dynasty was the end of what we all knew of kiss from back in the day . this album finally gave ace and peter a bigger roll vocally , which i was glad to hear . to me , it was about time that gene shared the spotlight with ace and peter . paul is all good , no criticism there ! dynasty is a group album , no one leads the way , it is shared and i am glad to seeher that . i never listened to any new kiss after this . i consider this album as a great end to the band we all newsome amountranted it is not as core as earlier stuff , but a fine exclamation point to a wonderful run .",194,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"dynasty is kiss 7th album , and until this point the band created some of the greatest , coolest heavy rock ever . dynasty is the last album with the four original members , and the last solid album from the band . dynasty is pretty good , and if you like the legendary kiss you will like it !",51,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"the year is 1979 , disco and pop are all the rage . it was the time of leisure suits , john travolta , beetles , and studio 54 . how does a hard rocking band like kiss compete ? by going along with the times . i quote paul stanley . you could write this stuff in your sleep . if we can get a hit doing this stuffsome amounts do it . of course i am talking about the awful i was made for loving you . they play it live occasionally only for nostalgia . the best tune on the album is by far aces version of 2000 man . i also like hard times also by the jendellian visitor . the entire album is basically soft pop , including aces which surprises me . after his barnstorming solo effort , i thought he was ready to rock out with his misstates . more than likely gene and paul had other plans for the bands direction . listen to dynasty then listen to hotter than he shall , you can barely tell it is the same band . this album was the beginning of the end for kiss , the original lineup anyway . it was not until creatures of the night that kiss got their heads out of their butts . unfortunately , ace and peter had left by then .",204,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,why ? this album sent kiss into the gutters for years . it was made for the wrong reasons . kiss was always the anti - disco and they did this . i would not recomend this album if your looking for righteous rock . the only reason it deserves 1 star is because of ace and his kick ass playing .,53,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"this is sort of a strange album for kiss . following the success of the solo albums and alive ii kiss was one of the biggest bands in the world . but even the biggest band can not live in a vacuum ; by 1978 disco was in full swing , and kiss sought to take advantage of this by releasing dynasty . several of the tracks on this disc have a very disco feel to them , particularly the intro track i was made for loving you . sadly , this foray into more modern music signaled a decline of sorts for kiss , as their popularity waned somewhat from here on out . that is not to say dynasty is not a worthy kiss album , just not one of their best .",121,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"then it is one . by this time in their career , they had lost most of their original audience by turning into a kiddie band . six year olds were at their shows with their mommies . so what does doofus gene do ? turns them into a disco band ! oh vey indeed . stick with everything up to alive one , then forget the rest . you will not miss anything .",64,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"this album has gotten a lot of criticism . if i would have been a little older liked kiss prior to this i would probably feel the same way those people do about it . it was a departure from what kiss had been doing . by this time the product marketing toys , comic bookstore amountunch boxes so on was out of control the solo albums were promoted with a massive advertising campaign that turned off many fans . i even heard one fan say this is not rock i roll ! so then comes i was made for lovin you , a disco flavored huge hit more to commercials promoting the return of kiss . all this understood , i was young enough that i was attracted to the same ad campaign that turned off so many . i was , after all , the target audience . years later i am proud to say i would end up liking kiss for the right reasons when i got a little older . this was my introduction although so maybe i am bias but i think dynasty is a great album . it remains one of my favorite kiss albums .",184,14

Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,i like this magazine . i like the articles and the pictures from the sets of movies . i am only giving it 4 stars because the kindle fire version can be frustrating . sometimes it can be hard to blow up pictures to get the full detail and other times the meaning of the picture is lost due to how it is presented in segments on the kindle rather than as a whole in the glossy paper magazine . i love getting the kindle version for it is conveniencesome amountightening fast delivery and smaller effect on the environment . but i do wish that they would fix the kindle fire format of the magazine so that it worked better .,114,9
Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,"the name says it all . total film is the only film magazine one needs for all the inside info on the latest hollywood offerings . unlike many entertainment industry journals , it focuses on the filmmaking process and leaves the star gossip column to lesser magazines . if you want to know the latest juicy info about your favorite stars sex likesome amountook elsewhere . if you are a film fanatic and wish to read about hollywood movies from concept to screen , then total film is for you .",84,10
Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,"it is always amazed me that the uk has two great movie magazines and the us has none . but i am happy to subscribe and get total film here in the states . there are two good uk film magazines : empire and total film . empire tends to be more formal and serious while total film really has fun with the subject and in my opinion , a bit younger vibe . i really love both and have subscriptions to each one through ipad and one through kindle . what i can say about the magazine is that these guys love movies and it shows in every section . each issue has a wide variety of topics without all the highbrow elitism that was so prevalent in premier magazine . yes , you can love pacific rim and rosselini at the same time . you get to try a month free with kindle highly recommend checking it out .",149,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"i bought this ad within 24 hours after seeing the movie years ago . i pretty well wore it out playing it in my car and singing along with it . so , i had to buy a new copy . i am usually not a fan of compilations , but this collection of songs is really well - done . the steve earle song , me and the eagle , is worth the price of the album itself , as are the songs by lucinda williams , iris decent , gillian welch , and emmylou harris , but they are all on the same album ! plus , there are great songs by the mavericks , the flatlander , george strait , and on and on . just a great album .",110,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"what a great concept , to have an album of songs inspired by a movie ! although only a couple of these songs were actually in the movie , they all feel comfortable and familiar , although i would never heard them before . reminiscent of the lonesome but contented feel of tom booker and his ranch . great western sounds , more traditional than what i hear on the radio lately . i enjoy the different sounds to the voices , sad and crying sometimes , independent and glad of it other times . good mix of vocal ranges . great album for an evening in front of a roaring fire .",99,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"the movie was a huge disappointment . at least 30 minutes too long , desperately in need of editing , and spending way too little time on the horse whispering and too much on people whining . however , this collection of country and western songs inspired by the script and a couple that actually got into the film is a winner . every performer on here does a good job with a worthy song . unlike the movie , the soundtrack may even be too short , considering it is quality . good balance of styles within a genre , of male and female voices , of sad and happy tunes . steve earle does a nice dylan imitation on his number , only with better diction than bob could manage .",116,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"i was disappointed in the ad thinking that i would get nothing but the soundtrack . i feel the description did not indicate that all songs were not from the movie and that is why i was very disappointed . i purchased it for a friend as a gift and they live in canada . they too were surprised and disappointed . because of logistics , we are not going to bother to return it . it would cost much more just shipping it back and forth to each other . the description needs to be more descriptive and state that all songs are not from the soundtrack . in going back to the site to see what i did wrong , i find i am also rather puzzled why the original score is some amount of money's it that limited ?",129,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,yes i liked it because i heard it in my childhood i would recommend this product to other people thank you,21,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"this is one of my favourite albums of all time . the production by the dust brothers beastie boys pals boutique , beck delay is uncluttered but very tasteful . it is mostly sample based with the occasional drum machine or bass played by flea red hot chilli peppers and vocals by idea davenport brand new heavies , but all the songs parts fit so well , it could have been created from scratch . tones vocals glide smoothly over top and no , he has not trying to change the world , but he brings humour and a relaxed feel to the strong production . the album did take me a couple of listens when i first got it in 1990 but the more i listened the more i liked it . it has a distinctive groove and is very easy to listen to .",134,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,this is a very good album period . great beats to all the songs and tone loc has a very original and good voice . the lyrics are pretty good to and it just makes you relax . i wish modern hip hop would be more like this . i would recommend this to anyone with an interest in quality rap .,57,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"i was about 10 years old when this album came out and i thought it was great at the time . i recently bought it so i could take a trip down memory lane and it was really a lot better in my memories than it is in reality . there has not a lot of creativity to his songs . he does have a unique voice , although . there are a couple of songs i guess i will probably listen to now and again for nostalgic reasons , that is funky cold medina and wild thing , but overall , meh .",93,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"tone - loc burst onto the scene in early 1989 with the now classic wild thing . the song sampled van havens james crying and had a video that clipped the style of the iconic addicted to love and featuring lots gravelly voice , the song soared up the pop charts to number 2 . the album climbed even further making it to number one becoming just the second album by a hip - hop artist to do as such . the album also features lots ode to spanish fly which is a tongue - in - cheek rap that uses a ton of samples most notably foreigners hot blooded . it rose to number 3 on the pop charts . the rest of the album is fun , but nothing is a memorable as the hit singles . cutting rhythms does have a fantastic break sampling band on the run and the homies pays tribute to his boys in the hood .",146,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"ignore the two radio cuts , which were beefed up with hard rock guitar samples for crossover potential , and dance to the spare but utterly funky backing tracks on the rest of this album . i just found my old cassette copy and . this is way funkier than many of the hip - hop albums being released these days . sometimes tone is too much on the beat and throwing out what you would expect ; other tiresome amounting on cutting rhythms , he leaves nice wide spaces between lines to let the words hit .",86,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,we misplaced our old tone loc ad and was very glad to find this item on amazon and at a good price .,22,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"this ad features tone lots two smash hits from the late 80s , wild thing and funky cold medina . these songs are both undeniable rap classics . unfortunately , the rest of the album is not as good as those two songs . most of the other songs are pretty forgettable , although on fire is pretty good . the album reaches a definite low point with the five minute long instrumental loin on the shaw , which loc does not even appear on . fans of old school rap may want to get this ad , if only for the two hits .",93,14
Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,i really liked to core premise of the story . the integration of the greys the augmentation technology was well done . i would recommend this book,26,0
Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,"for me , paying some amount of money for a kindle book was expensivesome amount , as i read so much i tend to focus on the 99 cents to some amount of money but this was worth it . once again , an aliens about to destroy the world book , sort of in the style of independence day . i really enjoyed it . the various characters were enjoyable and the various new technology was great . the elite group of humans chosen to be enhanced to cope with the aliens and slow them down was good fun the 2 alien species were good and as often indulged the area 51 conspiracy people combined with the ultimate twist . excellent battles and there was no feeling of trying to get thru the whole story quickly , so a good read . the possibility of a sequel was not a problem as this story still had a great conclusion .",143,1
Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,sacrifice i found this book to be easy reading and an awesome story line ! this is well worth the read for any sci - fi fans . seth libby could become the next guru of science fiction tales . once the background is established you have a hard time putting the book down . awesome !,53,2

Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,"i have never been one to read a sci - fi book , however i could not put this book down . while the authors influences are obvious , the story is masterfully crafted . i am anxiously awaiting a sequel .",35,7
Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,"quite a good action packed story . slow build up and ever increasing tension , somewhat unique story line . good twists and turns in the plot that did not telegraph where it was going . good characters albeit on the thin side . the tech is believable but never examined in detail , which is just fine . all in all a very good first book by a new author , well done . some of the things that keep it from being a 5 star effort are ; some cheesy dialog at times , some sequences and descriptions should have been done in more detail , and others were overdone . the author needs to keep a close eye on showing the story more , and keep the tell in check . i will definitely buy a sequel , but the author needs to rethink his pricing if he wants exposure . i would have passed on this book at the some amount of money price in a heartbeat if i had not exhausted every other possibility for a quick purchase among the new authorssome amount of money1.99 to some amount of money is where it needs to be if he wants to get known quickly .",180,8
Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,"i do not usually read scifi fantasy , but this caught my attention . i could not put it down once i started it . i loved the how it was told by time frames instead of just chapters . can not wait for the second book .",40,9
Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,"sets series has many flaws that irritate your and you are , to and too i which should be picked up at the proofing stage , but the stories do not lack dramatic presence . they are unashamedly space opera and minor matters like the utter improbability of ramming as an attack methodsome amountiven the vastness of space do not detract from the overall arc of the story . i am looking forward to the next installment .",71,10
Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,actually i only gave once 1 star . but : take a classic 1st contact story without imagination put then a young adult naive story with a pretentious style add the view of those patriotic american views mix with a super team of 9 enhanced men that crunch almost by themselves 2 advanced fleets then bring a super enhanced human beating all the superhero top it with such poor knowledge of man evolution on earth and you get a bad of . i gave it 2 stars because i least it does not bring also faith into the picture,96,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"this is one of apex twins earliest works , some people find it hard to believe that these tracks could have been made by someone as young as our mr. james but , that is irrelevant . saw1 is a collection of some of his best work and is the missing link between his polygon window and apex twin aliases . the album captures the true essence of his work , simple melodies which build with other sounds to form layered musical masterpieces . the production is raw and at some times even poor but , this adds tremendous character to the album would recommend you turn off those woofers ! as for the songs , the first 2 are fantastic chilled tunes , they drift like dead astronauts through space . the third was used recently by gary rhodes on his cookery programme ummm ! . green call is a pseudo - miami bass masterpiece which you are thoroughly not expecting after the subtle eno ambience of the previous track . he samples gene wilder to good effect in we are the music makers . ptolemy and delirium provide the mav at 2 am feel and are probably best heard at that time you will see . ! . buy this .",190,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,heard tal on a college radio station back in the early 2000s and was instantly addicted to the soundscapes on this album . i have probably listened to this album more than any other album that i have ever brought . managed to score a reissue on vinyl which is not bad since the price for the original goes for some amount of money on discos . i highly recommend this album if you are looking to explore in the vast world of music .,77,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"i really like the first half of this album a lot , but the last half just seems to run together especially the last 3 songs . every song on this ad would be considered ambient , excluding green call , which is still a very good song . if your a fan of apex twin , i would recomend buying this .",55,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"i think that in order to appreciate the true value of this breezy collection of richard james greatest ambient experiments , you need to turn the volume down . way down . this is not a rave ad , as some may suggest . it is music that is best enjoyed sitting in a room in front of two evenly - spaced speakers connected to a decent stereo set at a mid - low volume . so rarely do we approach music as a complete experience it often serves as the backdrop to a social event or a workplace , or provides filler to an otherwise silent space . selected ambient works 85 - 92 is not for dancing , driving , or doing dishes . it is for listening , in the same way one thoughtfully stops to listen in earnest to birds that have been chirping all the while , or to classical music at a symphony . the music was created with this kind of attention , and the listener must listen in kind to truly appreciate james magic .",160,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"although apex twins selected ambient works : 85 - 92 is primarily an ambient piece , it actually has some great appeal . songs like tal , tha and pulsewidth are incredibly relaxing and soothing pieces ambient classics ! . the electronic noises are superbyoull love most every song on this album . there are no voice samples here ; everything is digital . every song , except for green call which is kindle interesting is , essentially , an ambient masterpiece although ptolemy is more energetic and less ambient . if you are looking for an incredibly relaxing album then selected ambient works : 85 - 92 is a very very good purchase along with b12s electro - soma , the orbs adventures beyond the ultraworld and boards of canada music has the right to children . highly recommended ! highlights include : everything except for green call",126,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"a great album for dance parties . this album has some really nice dance rhythms and sounds , with a twist of techno . if you like dance it is good . if you like techno it is even better .",36,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"ok , i admit that i am partial to richard d. james , but this album is absolutely flawless . while musically his stuff has always been advanced , this ad really bridges the gap between his usually weird to the casual listener sounding works and danceable , poppy music . where in later releases james eventually adapted a more blip - bleep , frantic breakfeast style , in saw 85 - 92 every single track is organic and lush sounding . the major difference between saw 85 - 92 and saw volume ii for all you non - raj or apex twin fans , saw volume ii is a later released double album is that saw 85 - 92 is layered with catchy pop hooks and clubby industrial beats . think orbs little fluffy clouds , except more aggressivesome amounts vocal samples , and more variation . almost every track i almost , not all has a steady beat and is danceablethis is not brian eno ambience , but ambient techno . while it is not exactly chill room music , it is perfect at the end of a long party when everyone is tired and ready to collapse . brilliant , and a must listen .",171,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"this is one of the best metal albums of all time . it has catchy riffs and break - neck drum beats that stand up to any power metal album ever made . if you do not already own this album , stop wasting your time reading this and place an order .",46,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"this is the foundation where all speed metal started at . so many metal bands were started from this one ad . the next 2 cos after this one were the foundations of all power metal . so many metal bands were started from those 2 cos as well . that is the history that ad . the music itself . kai hansen singing is a little off here and there , but the guitar work is outstanding , and this is kick - you - in - your - face and take no prisoners metal . halloween would never be this heavy ever again , even until today . this was before michael kike came into the band . he would come into the band on the next ad that came after this one . also , if you like the halloween ep and walls of jericho ad , definitely make sure you get the batallions of fear ad and follow the blind ad from blind guardian. those 2 blind guardian cos are a direct clone / exact replica of the halloween ep and walls of jericho ad from halloween . even kai hansen sings some on the follow the blind ad from blind guardian.",178,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"this is one of the many reasons why i gave the middle finger to heavy metal and started listening to innovative death metal albums like deaths symbolic and celtic frosts into the pandemonium . it is nothing but the same damn power chord usage and sing along verses and choruses . kai hansen sounds like he was castrated to keep his absurdly high pitched voice and the drummer uses the same old double bass technique . this is for old , old school metalhead who refuse to grow and branch out into new territory . check out blind guardians imaginations from the other side for quality power metal . go listen to hypocrisy the fourth dimension if you want a diverse , unconventional otherwise known as false metal piece of music . p.s.-anyone who considers this definitive 80s german metal needs to listen to creators pleasure to kill , sodomy persecution mania , and destructions sentence of death or infernal overkill . those guys make halloween look like a bunch o nancy . metal heart signing out now .",163,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"well i did not care for this album till the day i downloaded victim of fate and how many tears and i was absolutely knocked down by the speed , fury and melody of these songs , then i decided to get it and i saw how stupid i was as i never gave it the attention it deserves.it is not as melodic or as original as the following albums , it is just a traditional harsh - headbanging - metal filled with lightspeed guitar riffs and pounding drums hammering your head for 70 mins.doubt itwill , give a listen to victim of fate , cry for freedom , ride the sky , heavy metal is the law , metal invaders and how many tears and you shall know what the fuck i am talking about ! a friend advise : if you enjoy metal you need to get this album right now , you shall certainly bang your head till the end of it !",141,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"if your like me and get a hankering for some teutonic head banging speed metal from time to time , this is usually one of the first discs i turn to . mind you , this is not the silky - smooth michael kike or andy debris fronted halloween , this is the speed metal or borderline thrash kai hansen fronted halloween . somewhat roughly produced , with mais nasal vocals , i have heard it takes some people awhile to get this album . i do not understand those people , i guess . there is nothing here but blazing melodic riffs , screaming vocals , winnowing bass and pounding drums . i challenge you to listen to ride the sky or victims of fate and not snap your neck head - banging or blow out an acl rocking down with your air - guitar . oh , and the guitar solos are a thing of majesty , words can not do them description accurately . just get yourself that new two - disc re - issue of this , quickly !",150,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"walls of jericho os an amazing album on it is own but the bonus disc is worth the asking price all by itself . the sound quality is great , the songs are amazing as they always have been , the bonus tracks are not to be missed each one solid . very happy .",49,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,halloween is a great german power metal band . and this ad is a great ad with their first recordings .,19,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"halloweens walls of jericho shows the real importance of kai hansen in the band . all the fast riffs , the epic choruses . all of what halloween was about was because of kai hansen . so , there has no surprise in finding gamma rays albums very similar to walls of jericho , and of course , if you like mammary , you will like this one .",57,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,this is an amazing album . the first halloween album i ever heard was dark ride . this album is much darker and more powerful . if you like speed metal or thrash this album is a must buy . probably their best . the newer albums seem toned down a little bit . i suggest this album and both keeper albums as well as dark ride and rabbit do not come easy . halloween is definately one of the most underrated bands around today . if you like metal or shred pick this album up !,87,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"halloweens debut is more of a thrash - metal vein than their more melodic keeper albums . this is not a bad thing at allthe album is full of great guitar and driving rhythms , a bit more metal and less melodic - rock than the next four albums . the main difference , although , is that while the following albums would have the more melodic singing of michael kike , here guitarist kai hansen is on vocals . while i really like mais singing in gamma ray in fact , i prefer it to any vocals in halloween , on this album he has a really harsh , unpleasant tone to his voice . i mind you , halloweens longest running and current singer andi debris does , too , but he has a bit better than kai here . if you like the vocals of debris or motorheads lemmy , this probably will not bother you , but i find the vocals on this album and , to a lesser degree the debris - era i kind of grate on my ears , and i am not always in the mood for it . the music itself is maybe a little less polished than later albums , but has that first album or underground - metal charm .",185,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"this album is very different than anything halloween has put out ever since . but this , in my opinion is their gem . this is straight up speed metal , and it is damn right amazing . the guitars are so melodic , the bass makes my skin crawl , and the pounding drums just make the whole sound elevate to a next level . on walls of jericho , you get to hear kai hansen singing his brains out and he does an amazing job at it . ride the sky is one of the most amazing songs i have ever heard , the guitars are really melodic . reptile has always been one of my favorites , on the chorus part , you can hear the bass follow mais voice , that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up ! heavy metal is the law has got to be the coolest heavy metal anthem ever , this song would make even man o war bow down to them . in short , you have to get this album to understand why so many years after it is release , it is still regarded as one of the best speed metal albums ever . the review on the bottom is also me , only that first i had done it anonymous .",203,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"halloween are pretty much known as the originators of power mettlesome amountargely due to this and the two keeper of the seven keys albums . walls of jericho is a melodic , fast , rip - roaring metal album , that at first listen you could easily call thrash . while it can easily hold it is own in the speed department against the thrash bands of the time , it is obvious there has something else going on here . because it sounds a lot like iron maiden too ! so what the he shall do we call this stuff ? that is power metal , kids , here in it is purest form . unfortunately it is a tad underrated , and i always felt it should be one of those required reading metal albums . the keeper albums are and rightly so , but jericho should be tacked onto those two albums as well , although the sound is a bit different from those albums - more raw and thrash . no one sounded like halloween . these guys were still are a very original , talented and extraordinary band . checks out walls and see where it started .",168,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"back when this album came out , i remember how some publications slagged it off by saying halloween were ripping off metallica and iron maiden . funny to see , some 20 years later , that their brand of heavy metal is the most raped formula in the epic or power metal movement . back in 1985 , halloween were a thrash band with a huge knack for writing memorable melodies and devastating thrash riffs and harmonies . unlike fellow german thrashes like destruction or creator , halloween preserved a lot of traditional metal in their dna , with virtually no punk or hardcore overtones except , maybe , the frantic pace of most of the songs here in . ride the sky , heavy metal is the law and the thrashing closer , how many tears are staples of speed or thrash metal . the vocals of kai hansen will please maiden fans and the drumming of into r.i.p. , with it is frenzied double bass mayhem , will surely please most thrashes . the album has lost none of it is impact and in no way does this sound dated this is , after all , power metal defined ! . do yourselves a favor and buy this album right now !",185,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"the vocals are a bit scratchy and hard to understand , but this album is totally brilliant . there is not a single track on it that i do not like . it is harder than halloweens later cos for sure ; this may be a good or bad thing depending on the person . when you want something with nonstop metal power , this is the ad to get . the inclusion of an entire separate ep and a bonus track in addition to the original album makes it that much better . this is definitely going to become one of my favorite cos .",94,13

Kindle_Store,B00L9FY2U4,"i really enjoyed this story . had a mix of emotions . although i think the author could have included a bit more to a few different chapters , i really loved madison and sawyer . i did not want the book to end . hoping there will be a sequel to fill in some missing pieces !",51,2
Kindle_Store,B00L9FY2U4,good book . i know times are different . but i guess i just was not brought up to use the language of today . i did enjoy the book except for that . you sure make it sound like all these two did was stay in bed ? nice if it works .,47,3
Kindle_Store,B00L9FY2U4,a great love story . it was not just a mushy story . it had so many components and it was emotionally orbiting . there were several times where i cried for the characters . my only regret is that kristy did not get her just dues .,42,4

Kindle_Store,B00L9FY2U4,"this book has obviously been heavily edited recently . reading through other reviews , i was like what the fuck are they talking about ? ! i do not think i have ever had such rollercoaster emotions while reading no , actually devouring a book . i was less than a percentage in when the tears started . not long after that i was shuffling around in my chair , feeling the sex coursing through me . so many emotions . anger , joy , hope , despair to name a few . i must admit , sawyer is not my favourite leading character . there has a weakness and vulnerability to him that i just can not handle . his loyalty to his big brother in the majority of the book goes beyond bounds . he confused me . i struggled to get a handle on his age . i am assuming closer to 30 , but he had something about him that just led my mind to picture him as a lot younger . i liked the storyline . it was quite predictable but then i guess it would not be a romance if there was not a hea . i really enjoyed the mixed point of view , particularly the little section from olivia . all in all this is a good debut book and i urge those of you read it pre edit to give it another go !",202,12
Kindle_Store,B00L9FY2U4,i did not expect that was refreshing . i will try not to reveal too much of said twist but it has to do with madison father and siblings . another aspect i enjoyed were the different perspectives of the characters . i will look forward to more literary works from aime,47,13

Kindle_Store,B009FMVUDA,if you have not read lewis sherry chaser you are in for a treat . after reading these books i became a chaser devotee . i bought his eight volume systematic theology and was not disappointed . chasers theology is spot on . he founded the dallas theological seminary in 1924 and was it is president until his death in 1954 . i,57,4

Kindle_Store,B009FMVUDA,"i read lewis sherry chasers exposition of the book of ephesians when i was a baby christian many years ago . it was an inspiration for my young faith , written in a way i could understand . i bought this book to read more , even although i have been a christian for more than 40 years . i am still inspired .",57,6
Kindle_Store,B009FMVUDA,"a must read for the serious bible student . the writing is the style of almost 100 years ago , but the message is timeless .",23,7
Kindle_Store,B009FMVUDA,"for me , there is no one like dr. chaser , or those who studied under him at dallas theological seminary . his knowledge about satan and grace are unsurpassed . if you want to really understand erwin rutgers books hitlers cross , when a nation forgets god and oprah , miracles , and the new earth , read dr. chasers book satanic motives and methods . it really sheds light on the satanic influence behind all 3 of those books . chasers book grace exposition of gods marvelous gift is a phenomenal explanation of all that gods grace entails . a must read . since they are still under copyright , this does not include his systematic theology or the book major bible themes . these are worth the effort to acquire and read . major bible themes is really a summary of everything else that he wrote .",138,8
Kindle_Store,B009FMVUDA,outstandingly complete and well organized . i just received the 8 volume series only 3 weeks ago so this is a process which should take quite some time as it is a study and not just a read . they used to teach this in the dallas seminary . it is something all who wish to enter the pastor or teacher life should consider . i will try to remember to return a year from now for an actual review .,71,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"i heard kiefer sutherland promoting rocco deluca and decided to check it out . kiefer , jude cole and their ironworks company have delivered a jewel . this is refreshingly original rock and roll . many other reviewers have talked about how different this ad is from so much of what is being pumped through the airwaves . check out the previews of the tunes and you will want the whole album ! i am hooked !",68,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"in a time where music seems to be nothing but cookie cutter music along comes rocco deluca the burden . not only is his music original , he also has a great and powerful voice . a must buy .",37,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"i have tried to give this ad a chance because of all the great reviews . i have listened to it in different places , moods , and came back to it again and again hoping that it would grow on me . however , do not buy this edit will be wasted money . it is less than average . i would rather take a chance picking a ad blindly out of a used box of cos . the music is bland at best , has no originality , and i can only conclude that the great reviews are from friends of the band . or as the reviews would suggest , k. s. fans . give yourself and your ears a break not waste your time .",119,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"i saw this band perform on one of the late shows , and i was not impressed . however , i purchased the ad , hoping that my first impression was incorrect . it was . rocco and his burden deliver a unique , original album full of songs that are perfect for any situation , be it a party , or just kicking back to relax . they really show their ability in an interesting array of tracks , ranging from twangy and almost country to alternative rock . must - hears on this album are track 4 , bus ride , and track 9 , mystified . fantastic !",92,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"thank god music is not dead ; i was beginning to despair that my declining years would be spent in agony listening to dull blasting beats from britney - spear - clones and repetitive violent gangsta - raps . then along comes ironworks music to save the century of new rock ! jude coles delivering rocco into our arms to hold close and savor his heart - felt melodies made me want to weep and dance for joy at the same time real music , to continue singing a kinship to the soul of good people everywhere ! i look forward to more of jude cole , rocco , and ironworks music !",94,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"i saw rocco deluca the burden when they opened for robert randolph i the family band , and i was blown away . rocco live show is incredible , i was entranced by every song , and this is atypical because usually , i do not really enjoy performances unless i am at least familiar with the music of the artist . the passion in the performance and the voice of this band blew me away . so i excitedly purchased the ad . after listening to the studio ad , however i was disappointed . the power of the live show of this band did not translate , and the music sounds like something i have heard before , instead something to be excited about . the ad is still very good , and i would suggest buying it , because lyrically it is very mature , and the use of the dobry resonator guitar is very different . some of the highlights include the songs favor , soul , and dope . if you have the opportunity however see them live . then you will see why their first ad is only the beginning .",174,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,i really enjoyed hearing a kind of old school sound with a touch of modern edge . rocco voice is what gets me . i love it . i really enjoy the hearty feeling to some of the tracks and how it builds into an explosion of sound . the only downfall to the ad is that it is kinda all over the place with the overall vibe . i felt like he was trying too hard to show all of the stuff he can do .,80,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,this is the best music i have heard in a very long time . a refreshing blend of the modern with undertones of blues and other genres of music . well worth the money .,32,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"regardless of the hype involving heifer sutherland and late night to appearances for this number , i expect a good album to affect me in a way independent of label or connection . i begrudgingly admit this one does . from the first track on through the entirety , i was surprised by the dexterity of a rather humbly broadcasted ad . the burden and co. are fairly new , but the appeal is broad . it is a breathy mix of coldplay , incubus , and a bit of old word indie sound that makes a good sing along as well as a disc i could excitedly say , threesome amountisten ! without later being embarrassed . none of the songs come off as filler and the variety in melody and approach keep it from being bland or like six bowls of similar musical soup . i would gladly recommend this to someone looking for a mellow experimental sound mixed with tremulous effect and raw talent and bark at them to snatch this up . it is well worth the minutes spent hearing it .",169,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"this is one of the best albums i have purchased in the last couple years . the album successfully blends different genres and makes it all work . there has rock , blues , alternative , punk , americana and other genres influencing the sound . thank you ironworks for putting out a band grounded in rock and blues !",50,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BKSITO,some amount need to go back in the studio and re write their lyrics . this album is wack and is not worth the money .,22,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BKSITO,"down some amounting is a terrible album , with that idiotic song laffy taffy and other terrible songs , the writing is pathetic , the rapping is awful , the beats are ridiculous and everything else is headache inducing . down 4 life should called down 4 death this is one of the worst albums of the year .",53,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BKSITO,i have come to the conclusion that if you enjoy a group i will not acknowledge them as musicians like d4l than you must have some kind of severe head trauma . this is some of the most forgettable and thoughtless music that i have ever heard .,43,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BKSITO,"this album is a good snap album . it also has a few crunk songs on it . like stuntman , i am the man , bulkhead . this album is good for those who are in to snapping and rocking . if this is not ur type of music do not buy the damn album !",47,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BKSITO,"the last time i wrote a review for this ad i had not listened to it in it is entirety , but most recently i did . i highly recommend that no human being spend their hard earned money on this trash , although laffy taffy is a catchy song , it is highly overrated . this group simply can not rap , they use the overused subjects in their songs present in most modern day rap music , such as degrading women , having bling blingsome amountetting money , sex , and more not only this group can not rap , but the music sounds very cheap . the dollar store must have had a super sale on keyboards when this was recorded . if this album were a film it would definitely be the straight - to - video or made - for - cable kind . bottom line : poor rapping , simplistic lyrics , and cheap - sounding music . you have been warned !",135,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BKSITO,"this is by far one of the worse things i have ever heard . right up there with thingy or change or whatever it is . they should be ashamed . it is a miracle that can say laffy taffy and still show their faces in public . for shame for shame . for the record , d4l , to para - quote your own lyrics , no i can not do it it like you nor would i want to . i would never suck so bad . 1 star here it comes .",79,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000BKSITO,"i am a man who loves his classic rock , but i do not shun modern music . however although , i just hate bands like these who add absolutly nothing to to the music scene other than giving people urges to gouge their ears out . this is just terrible . laffy taffy is the worst song of the year . we need some good music to come out . i can not say that much , other than this stuff will be on it is way . read the other reviews as well , they all know what they are talking about , but i am just adding the back up , for the sake of power in numbers .",106,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,after waiting for just over three years for alanis newest record i can say that it was well worth the wait . each song on under rug swept stands solidly on it is own . it seems that as alanis has grown as an artist that she has lost the strained high - pitched moan that came at the end of many of her lyrics on jagged little pill . i praise alanis for such a fantastic piece of work and can not wait to see her on the under rug swept tour .,86,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"under rug swept is definitely the best ad of alanis career as of yet . every single song has it is own charm to embrace , and you can listen to them over and over and never get tired of them . alanis strongpoint has always been in her lyrics , and i love to sing along with this ad . my favourite songs are the first four : 21 things that i want in a lover : because it is fun and the lyrics are great , sometimes you even have to laugh . narcissus is cheeky and upbeat . obviously i have to include hands clean , this albums reminiscent single . and flinch , being on the slower side , stills bears a positive message . another good song is surrendering . if you do not have this ad yet , all i can say is that you had better have a good excuse for waiting . this is a must - have !",143,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"alanis is my favorite music performer and song writer . i love every ad and recommend them all to anyone who wants to hear the truth , be inspired and heal their heart .",31,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"only two words describe this album : sheer brilliance ! . i love each and every song on this album , and there is only one other album that i feel the same about , and that is jagged little pill . this album has the same feel about it as jagged little pill , so for those who loved jagged little pill , i think you will love this album just as much , if not more . this album has everything , from the guitar filled rock of the outstanding 21 things and a man , to the ballads like the deeply moving at that particular time and alanis wish for a better world utopia , and everything in between ! all alanis lovers and even those who have not liked her previous albums , i encourage you to buy this album . sheer brilliance !",129,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"alanis has been criticised for using unabridged sentences , and . awkward syntax with . distorted phrases . as any fan will tell you , this is what we love about alanis , the way she will take a simple feeling , alanisise it then throw it back out twisted and reworked so we have to think about her wording to uncover what she means , that is her artistic license that makes her so addictive and unique . do not be put off by supposed former infatuation junkies not so hot reviews , it was not well received , but under rug swept in in some ways a back to basics album with great melodies , thought provoking lyrics that make u smile with recognition of having the same thoughts and feelings in your own past relationships . if you are looking for a reason to come back to alanis , this is it . a fantastic album .",141,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"this is truly some of alanis best work . the album hardly has a bad track . each track is a strong as the other , and this was the case with her jagged little pill album . my favourite alanis album is suppossed former infatuation junkie , because alanis was completely original on that record . but under rug swept is definately one of her best so buy it . you will not regret it highlights : 21 things , so unsexy , precious illusions , hands clean , narcissus , a man , u owe me nothing , surrendering , utopia !",86,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"even the first time i listened to this album i was hardly impressed . you owe me nothing is the only song that sounded somewhat original and interesting . as for the rest of the album , it is either too pop , or too dull . amazing , although , how the music videos , that were made to promote under rug swept , were still original . whereas with the release of alanis newest ad so called chaos , the videos are cheese judging by alanis music video for everything .",80,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"under rug swept is a really amazing disc . morissette has taken production control and created a musical set with complex , sometimes hysterical lyrics and a rhythm focusedsome amountuitar - heavy melody . absent is the frenetic musical experimentation that was supposed former infatuation junkie and in it is place is a more cohesive and structured album . . the angry girl depiction has become such a media and critics cliche . on under rug swept she does not so much rant at men as she describes her own place in these dysfunctional relationships . beautifully written , these songs may sound like stream - of - consciousness poetry , but at least they are thought provoking and delivered with great vocal finesse . it is about style , baby , and morissette hook is the vocal and linguistic game of tag that she plays throughout her songs . ripped vocals and sexy melodies wrap themselves nicely around morissette writing , making this a truly wonderful disc . 21 things i want in a lover , hands clean and you owe me nothing in return are three of her strongest tracks to date and alone make the album worth owning . just check out this album .",176,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"i like the album . yup , it has a different style or sound from jagged little pill , but that is part of the fun of following a musicians career . sit backbone amountisten , and enjoy the journey they take us on ! if every album sounded the same , then i would say a musician was not growing .",50,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"i really think this is alanis best work , i absolutley loved it ! jap and said where great , but the songs in this album are amazing . her voice , but especially the lyrics are mesmerizing . my favorites are 21 things . , flinch , hands clean , but especially that particular time . other songs like utopia and so unsexy are so very powerfull . i think there isn't a songwriter as great as alanis , my best friend and i love her , we have all of her cos . we just hope that her next studio album does not makes us wait too much . she's definetely a gifted artist !",99,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"after hearing the terrific songs so unsexy and hands clean on the radio , i rushed out and bought what i hoped would be a smart , energetic , insightful ad . what i discovered instead was alanis morissette basically recycling the same music she used on her jagged little pill ad . only this time , her lyrics are more obtusesome amounts accessible , and less compelling . there are a few bright spots on the ad , such as the songs i mentioned . but , overall , the ad is rather negligible and self - involved . i believe only die - hard fans of morissette will get any real mileage out of this vapid collection . ironically enough , i purchased lisa lobes new ad cake pie the same day i bought this one , and that ad surprised me by being the musically superior to morissette effort . so if you want some great new chick rock , check out that title .",146,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"i am not sure i would suggest this album for those who loved her previous albums but for hard core fans it has it is moments . she used to be my favorite artist until i got this album , it is just not full of her characteristic i hate the world and everyone in it attitude i fell in love with . if you are looking for something more positive an up beat , check this one out ! if not , i would listen to the samples above before spending your money . you never know , you may like it anyhow !",90,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"one thing that has surprised me about alanis is that she has maintained her artistic integrity i this is quite a thing to do in an era when we or time or aol regularly makes hit records by profiling songs on smallville . ironically swept is published by warner ! hehe . alanis lyrics are easily understood . her syntax and phrasing are not faulty i in fact her singing is part of a distinctly canadian performance style . our lady peace is a good example . if you want easy listening pick up a logos album . as for her stream - of - consciousness songs , this is something unique and rare . alanis is baring her soul in the way that best fits her own personality . this album deserves five stars . alanis broke the mold with her first album . her newest release proves why she is the most impressive female rocker of the last decades has more consistency , creativity , integrity , and passion .",149,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"as with her previous project , alanis has once again shown that she is growing both as an artist and as a person . the angry white female recovering from childhood and a series of bad relationships is perhaps even less present on this album then on the follow - up to jagged little pill . alanis once again delivers with her unique ability to combine melodic riffs and enchanting hooks with powerful lyrics that will stay swiming in your head long after you are done listening . perhaps the only negative is that the stream of consciousness lyrical style is a little difficult to keep up with at times as it has a tendency to babble a bit .",113,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"being a long - time alanis morissette fan and after waiting for 3 and 1/2 years for a new studio recording , the first thing i did today was run out and buy her new album . it was definitely worth the wait ! she is an amazing artist and has , once again , proven her worth as an extremely talented musician . her lyrics are poignant , touching and brutally honest . her journey of self - discovery have helped me through some of my most heart - breaking experiences . once again , she has given me a wonderful album of incredible music and gut - wrenching honesty . thanks for sharing yourself with us , alanis ! you are amazing !",102,14

Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,like many others with a somewhat different twist . enjoyable .,8,0
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,i enjoyed the beginning but it quickly became a jumbled mess . i was not impressed with the way the author worded some of the sentences . she did not have a good flow to the story . it was not a believable story . very messy .,43,1
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,fast paced with twists and turns . i enjoyed it and could not put it down even when i could not stay awake . thanks for the awesome entertainment .,25,2
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,"i am glad that i did not let these reviews stop me from buying this book ! it seems that readers are forgetting that books are for entertainment purposes . this book entertained and intrigued me with the different time period . key words being different time period . of course the characters are going to converse differently than we are used to today . independent authors have enough of an uphill battle against big name publishers , readers should not bash them for slight typos that do not take away from the story at all ! if you like a good story about relationships , pick this book and the others by claire charlies up and you will not be disappointed .",110,3
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,"this was a different type of mail order bride book . this book had a lot of sadness and in the end passion . love at first sight was everything for this couple . read it , you will enjoy .",36,4
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,"stories about the old west including those about mail order brides have always been interesting and some of my favorites . this book was terrible . did the five star reviewers and i even read the same book ? there was zero character development , the story was all over the place and a nightmare to try and read . it was filled with childish writing , short , choppy sentences and in serious need of a proofreader . the poor excuse for a bedroom scene was just that . i agree with another reviewer who wondered how it ever got published .",93,5
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,i really enjoyed this book . i read a lot and this book helped my attention . the details of that era was so enjoyable,23,6
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,"fun story of a mail - order bride , her husband , and his brother , in an unusual triangle . i have become a fan of charlies books and look forward to her next publication .",29,7
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,i love the theme but it was a little depressing until the end . certain points of the story were never finished - i would have liked to found out how her family did after she left .,34,8
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,"i think the idea of this story is a good one . similar to many others , but still the good basis for a mail - order bride story . unfortunately , the writing was poorly done . there were many grammar mistakes and it just did not flow well .",41,9
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,a good book . would have been much better without explicit sex .,11,10
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,this is book 2 . it was a great read . there were several typos but not so bad as to ruin the flow of the story . at times it felt a lil rushed but not to the point where the feeling and emotion were lost . loved the characters . i can not wait for book 3 !,53,11
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,the characters were not at all well developed . the editing was poor . the story was a mess . how on earth did this book get published ?,24,12
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,the west can be wild and dangerous . eliza needs to help her family how can she do that ? mail order brides were popular in the wild west could eliza find happiness and help her family that way . only time will tell,41,13
Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,"the story line keeps you guessing from beginning to end . i believe i had read this book before , but it was good to read it once again .",27,14
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,interesting side story but yet still pertinent to the who series . waiting for the second one in this side series .,20,0
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,"i have read all of the sideward sectors books and find this one just as fun to read . now between you two watcher brothers start working on the next book already ! . i finished the original series and keep checking and nothing ! now i finished this book and look for the admiral invincible and nothing . i want more ! great job ! for new people thinking of reading this start with the admiral who book first , you need to get the lingo and base story down so the rest makes sense . it reads fast and easy . lots of action filled parts , funny parts and parts that made me want to cry . overall a good plot that allows from book to book .",118,1
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,"i am glad they are expanding the sideward sectors universe . the book follows along and explains what happens to middleton when he is on his patrol . a good mix of action and plot building overall . it could have been better , but it could have easily been worse . very easily . i look forward to the continued story of middleton and anymore about the little admiral .",63,2
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,"the sideward sector series is not books that can be in a piecemeal fashion where a chapter or is read then put down for couple of weeks to be continued later . these books . fun and additive . the characters live as you read there stories , and you cheer for their . success an feel their failures and loses . mr. watcher has done a remarkable job creating this series and continues to keep wanting more . i encourage readers to start this series now and you will have a wonderful summer enjoying these great stories . thanks for hearing me . chuck",96,3
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,"this book continues the tradition of excellence i have come to expect from watcher brothers . people who have enjoyed the admirals world will love this addition to it is universe , while they wait for the next main admiral book .",38,4
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,this is a great addition to the inward sectors seriescaleb keeps the story true to the feel of the original series while adding his own unique style . great job can not wait to read more .,36,5
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,"this is a spin off of the authors brothers admiral series which has gone from a fun adventure to something complex , multi - stranded and rapidly becoming a epic opus in scope . it could largely be read on it is own if you are not familiar with the core books but best combined with them . and this starts as a good palate cleanser with a more focused story that introduces some excellent new characters to the universe . but as the series develops the forth book , knights mission : a house divided , which is the start of the second trilogy has just been published it become less of a diversion and more of a stand alone , universe in mortal peril story that impacts it is bigger brother . excellent ship to ship battle , series ground pounding action with the author brave enough loose major characters during them ensures real tension and a sense of risk when it matters all combine to deliver on a satisfying book and a great series to get into .",165,6
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,i enjoyed the story line and the completed characters . really think the over done military verbiage cumbersome to where a reader would just skip pages to get over the mambo jumbo hub . the story the characters and the viability of the whole is wha i think i important . the rest are just page fillers written for no one but the author,61,7
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,"an absorbing story with great characters , thrills and suspense . from the first encounter where the bad guys use a real wed to the discovery of a much greater threat , it is a story you will not want to put down before you have reached the end . then if you are like me you will be looking for the next book in the series . highly recommended .",61,8
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,as good or better than the main series . easy to identify with the characters . good action . some nice surprises . recommended .,20,9
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,it would have beeen nice to see something other than luck play the deciding factor in the patrols success .,19,10
Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,good reading not great but good enough to keep your attention,11,11

Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007AZ93,"this magazine has become my favorite tool for my spiritual awakening . the articles are articulate , heart - felt , and easy to understand . since they only have four issues a year , you have time to reflect upon each article and get the most from the writer . it also gives me time to read over several times and keep finding new things . i have found so much joy in this subscription and now family members are reading , too . this makes for positive conversation at family dinners . there is no political agenda and the magazine speaks of science as well as spirituality , which i think is important . i will be subscribing as long as they keep writing . namaste .",113,0

Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007AZ93,"for some time i had been looking for an interfaith spiritual magazine at the level of seekers with some experience . this one is based in hinduism but contains articles on other traditions and evidences religious tolerance . at a certain level of practice and experience the boundaries which divide us are just plain wrong thinking . this magazine would be a good basic education for beginners but also seems challenging enough for a well - worn traveller on the road . it is literate and sophisticated , and the graphics are beautiful and inspiring .",88,7

Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007AZ93,"i discovered this journal in a news stand at an organic market and found it fascinating throughout . i liked the discussions about vedic as well as buddhist and other philosophies . the articles show the ways in which the ancient wisdom traditions on enlightenment or awakening are closely related . there is just no argument about this , only different words used to describe the same experience . a refreshing read .",65,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"just as in my review of vol . one , the only way to release a greatest hits collection from these guys was to do it over six discs like they already did .",31,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"10 songs from the last 4 records just is not going to do it . the major flaws here are : 1 the inclusion of the song remains the same and no quarter , which are definitely the strongest or most memorable tracks from houses of the holy 1973 i such as over the hills and far away , the ocean , dancing days , or dyer maker . 2 the inclusion of 10 minute achilles last stand from the weakest record , presence 1976 , could have been replaced with 2 - 3 much better , more memorable songs from other records over the hills and far away , the ocean , dancing days , dyer maker , fool in the rain , or in the evening . save the money from purchasing these two compilations and spend the money on the complete recordings and make your own compilation .",131,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"it is true that the ad does not have many great songs like fool in the rain and dancing days , but it is still a great ad . if you buy both the early days and latter days , you might find yourself ignoring this ad completely , so you have to be careful . but just give it a few tries and you will be hooked . note to page or plant or jones : enough boxed sets ! please !",68,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"getsome amounts face it . not everyone is a real led zeppelin fan by most of your standards . i , for one , am relatively eclectic in my selection of music . i consider myself a real fan but i do not need absolutely everything they ever released . these compilation cos were the answer to my dilemma as to how to get most perhaps not all of my favorites without having to spend a lot of money all at once . i really enjoy these cos and i would encourage anyone interested to purchase them . after all . a fan is a fan no matter which way you look at it and we are all spending the same color of money .",109,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"this one is a bit of a let down after the near perfect programing of the early days comp . surely it would have made more sense to include the best tracks off of houses of the holy and done without 11 minutes of achilles last stand . but , it does provide a good purchasing option , in that it does not seem redundant to buy houses of the holy along with this . the songs from physical graffiti are exactly the ones i would have picked houses of the holy , trampled underfoot , kashmir and the later selections are good enough . i do like achilles last stand . the book of photos is wonderful .",108,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"led zip was a good band , but this ad is becoming very commercial . i like hard rock music but not like this compilation ! because many fans already owned the original lips .",31,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"this and early days are not for real fans . these two greatest hits are good for simply introducing people to led zeppelin . to get the real scope of led zeppelin , buy either the complete studio recordings or the 4 - ad box set .",41,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,awesome album . i recommend this album . great musicsome amountreat artist . you should add this ad to your library . i did .,20,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"completely awesome ! i like the early one better , but i am not complaining about any zeppelin ! it is better if you get the individual cos , but oh well ! i definitely recomend it ! get it !",32,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"well i gave this ad a 5 - star rating because the music on it is , well , zeppelin , and nothings better than that . i do not know why it is called a best of . series , when in fact vol . 1 and vol . 2 are both lacking major radio staples . on vol . 2 , where has dyer maker , dancing days , the ocean , fool in the rain , and more ? those are always on the radio , more than ten years gone and achilles last stand , anyway i am not putting those last two songs down , they just are not as big hits as the first ones . . i would say this might be a worthwile introduction to zip for the beginner , but the masters series might be better . for those of us who want better led releases page or crowds the greek comes close , and it is pretty good ! , we will have to wait til earls court or knebworth gets released .",145,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,this is an amazing ad . this ad is great from the first song to the last . this is a great ad for new zip listeners and it is good for the old ones because of the kashmir video,37,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,how can anyone say that this collection is less than 5 stars ? if you do either you must not like led zeppelin and therefore should not be listening and giving it bad reviews or your just flat out mentally inhibited .,39,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"houses of the hollow can you eliminate anything at all from that . buy the original . physical graffiti was a two record set , to sum it up in 3 songs is impossible . presence and in through the out door , well a couple from each of those is all they warrant . overall a failure as an anthology .",55,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003ZA2Y,"a nice compilation , but do yourself a favor , save your money , and just buy the original albums . you will probably end up doing so anyway .",24,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"stravinskys music changed the world . this repackaging of the cumbersome multibox set issued previously has been very well done . the performances are unique in that stravinsky conducts all his major works robert craft conducts 1 ad of smaller works extremely well . the sound is incredibly good throughout considering the hatchet jobs columbia records now sony used to bestow on some of their artists in the 1960s . however , that some in that company had the presence of mind to capture these performances for posterity must be thankfully acknowledged . 5 stars for the real thing .",93,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"sound is better than ever , if you do not ear difference is a problem of equipement , i already have the original jacket edition and this is superior in soundsome amounting the other people i am in trouble with sony , if you purchase this item , you are a serious collector , why do not ask for more money but give a complete libretto and info , this is the only problem with this edition , do not hesitate in buy these cos , only the ballets cost more in separate cos",82,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"this is a great collection of recordings . i am glad that cos columbia had the foresight to have the composer conduct these works before his death . if you are a stravinsky fan , this is the ultimate collection .",36,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,as described and wonderful to listen to . excellent customer service . a experience .,12,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"if you love stravinsky or the copeland or bartok or shostakovich or and more variant of 20th century music , you must buy this for the sheer price performance . if not , buy it anyway and listen to the pieces in chronological order , progressing to the next piece only when the current piece makes sense to your ear . i skip the [ very early ] symphony in e - flat , and be prepared for a few clunkers . i be ravished .",65,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"i really consider this the best deal i have ever gotten on amazon ; i purchased this new for some amount of money this set includes a majority of stravinskys works , and definitely provides the most important ones . more importantly , all of these recordings are conducted by stravinsky himself , which is most definitely a huge plus . the audio quality is great , and of course nothing can be said about the interpretation since they are his own . the price for this many works is astounding , and i highly recommend this to any classical enthusiast .",89,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"it is been a very long time since i have waiting for stravinskys ballets by stravinsky , even although i have some very good performances by voulez , einstein and abba . but nothing like original authors direction , the scent of his work beyond formalism of the score . and finally , i made it . and even more ! having a complete box containing the works of stravinsky by stravinsky is a real treasure , by all means . this box set is quite complete , excellent sound and very cheap . only two observations : one , operas and melodramas need lyrics and , two , it would be much better considering some works in it is original languagesome amounting les notes . anyway , excelent job and very convenientsome amounting it a try !",113,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"yes , i have strong sympathy for all the reviews which have given five stars rate to this box set herebefore . i bought the same music in mid - line 22 ad luxury box incarnation under the title igor stravinsky the recorded legacy last year . sure the bargain box set edition here offers even more value economically and will benefit more music lovers in the world . you can say nothing except listening to breathlessly when igor stravinsky , as both the composer and the exponent , conducts the performances of almost all his own music , to say nothing of the consistently excellent sound quality , which is especially important to the music of stravinsky . many thanks to sony or cos production team who made not only excellent original recordings but also marvellous ad transfers . a great achievement indeed ! i would also like to recommend everyone stravinskys small but meaningful book poetics of music . it tells you what his attitudes to music are , illuminates further your experience of listening to his music and let us you know why so much influence he has long had on other composers of the world . let us go back to stravinskys music and enjoy it .",190,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,this box set is absolutely wonderful ! i enjoy listening to stravinsky conducting his own worksite the ultimate interpretation . i have no complaints .,24,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"as a musicologist and music theorist , we are enjoying the historic recordings of these great works . we wish that personnel lists were included , but that is difficult to obtain in these cases .",32,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"when columbia cos decided to record all the works of stravinsky conducted by the composer , it became one of the most spoken about ventures during the 60s and 70s . i remember the vinyl box set and how i wished i had the extra money to acquire this set . now sony has remastered the sessions on ad . these are awesome performances of some of the greatest music written in the 20th century .",71,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,". but why could not they re - master them ? having just watched jewels by the paris opera ballet on did , i was curious about his carpaccio for piano , which was the first from this set i played . this was the music to rubies , the second of the jewels which was hilarious , exciting , touching , and what else can i say ? very sexy . i was not disappointed . if you are a stravinsky - ite , this set is a must . highly recommended .",73,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"previously a full set of all of stravinskys work was well over some amount of money and since that version is out of print , it sells for far more now . where can you get 22 cos of music for some amount of money ? i am thrilled with this set , although there is just one small booklet with very little material in it . a nice plus is that each ad jacket does have the selections listed on the back . it is a cheapo cardboard box and the cos are in paper sleeves , but what can one expect for some amount of money ? if you have always wanted a full set of all stravinskys work without paying through the nose for it , this is the set for you . this set does not always contain the best interpretations of stravinkys work , but most stravinsky fans will buy copies of their favorites as well as owning this complete set . includes some stravinsky rehearsals too , as well as a clip of stravinsky talking about the rite of spring . includes some suites as well as the full work .",173,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"this is a staple for anyone owning a stereo and a ad player . it is a learning experience . a bit of an acquired taste , a foreign language that one has to learn , when we only know our own language . it is complex . it is sometimes intellectual . it is moody . it is fascinating from a sound point of view , instrumentation . it is fresh . it is real .",59,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,got this for my dad for his birthday . he is a huge fan of stravinskys work ! loves the whole collection and would recommend it to any fan of stravinsky you literally get all of his works famous and not but excellent selection . sound quality is amazing no static at all ! definitely would recommend .,53,14

Kindle_Store,B00CL8MAYS,"great good fun in the days when napoleon appeared to be on the straight road to the domination of europe . duval is a likeable hero of dry with and increasingly discerning detecting talents . although i have only read three books in the series , they cover the beginning , middle and apparent end of the heros fifteen - to - twenty year policing career . the author is filling in the missing years and adventures at her own pace , and at random , so it will pay to keep checking back to see when duval will appear again , with another well - researched tale of adventure and daring - do .",98,0

Kindle_Store,B00CL8MAYS,i was hooked from the very first page ! the characters where so real and the story telling was so fluid . i did not want to put it down . i gave it only four stars because i felt like the ending was very abrupt . i thought the story was going to take on a new twist and then i was at the epilogue,61,12
Kindle_Store,B00CL8MAYS,"well written . good , character development but not over done . felt like i was back on the streets of paris after the revolution i would recommend to anyone that likes historical novels",31,13
Kindle_Store,B00CL8MAYS,"this well - done novella comes across as a very authentic paris of 1800 . the story contains enough color , mystery , action and romance to make a good read . refreshingly , and i am assuming credit goes to my wrath , the text was free of the misspellingssome amountmatical errors , or just plain incompetent writing that is becoming all too common in e - books .",58,14
Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,this has been one of my most favorite couples . garrett point of view made me love him even more . allie has given so many dimensions to these characters and this story . i would love to get garrett point of view on all the books in this series,43,0
Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,adds only a couple of interesting details . lots of repetition from the first book,14,1
Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,"i thoroughly enjoyed reading garrets point of view . it helped bring more of the story together . i loved the first 5 books in jades point of view , but reading this in garrets was excellent . i really hope the author will write the rest of the books from garrett point of view as well . i love love jade and garrett and can not wait to read more about them !",67,2

Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,"so i finished the first book pretty late and tried to sleep afterwards . except that was pretty much impossible , and i ended up having to grab this one and get little to no sleep . this is everything that happened in choosing you , but from garrets point of view . if you have read the first book , then you already know he has pretty freaking awesome . getting to see the story told from his perspective really just helped me love him more than i already did . the biggest issue is that there is a lot of repetitious story line . sometimes it felt like she just copied and pasted paragraphs from jades point of view but changed the name to garret . although there are some new scenes , and those were definitely worth the read . i think it would be pretty awesome to read more of the storyline this way although .",145,8
Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,"really enjoyed garrets point of view . it was a little hard to remember specific details from choosing you since it is been so long . i should have re read it first . nonetheless , it was a great addition to the series . i want a garret point of view for every book now ! loved finding us in the dual point of view .",55,9

Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,"this was a good addition to the jade series . i have read it since book 1 and could not not read this . this book really dives into things you did not know about garrett and events that you never saw in book 1 . i know it is a lot like book 1 and a lot of it repeats because it basically is book 1 in his view , but you learn so much about garrett . this is a great read , if you enjoy the jade series you will enjoy this .",87,11
Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,i loved reading this from garrett point of view ! i would have every book written in his point of view if i had my choice . please please please write at least one more !,31,12
Kindle_Store,B00NPBV6DG,"this series is my favorite , i love the relationship between jade and garret . being that this book is garret i point of view from the 1 it book in the series , makes me love him even more now that i know where he was coming from and all his feelings about certain parts of the book . this book whole series makes me lose track of time and constantly want more .",70,13

Kindle_Store,B00DYG88QA,"cute and informative book on big cats any child will enjoy ! i really liked the photographs of the big cats and the author has done an excellent job to help the reader focus on preservation of these beautiful animals . the chapter on ocelots reminded me of when my father , who was an auto mechanic , fixed a ladys car and went to road test it . he heard a noise in the back seat and turned and was face - to - face with her pet ocelot ! needless to say the road test was over ! is cusser makes these big cats come alive in her pages . a must have for all childrens libraries .",107,5

Kindle_Store,B00DYG88QA,what i found from this kids book is the wide array of big cats featured with vivid images . i have been following this series from alice for quite some time now and all of her books are short and easy read and understand . it takes mastery in order to part knowledge to our children so this is a job done beyond that . if your child likes jungle animals like these i found another great book that teaches how to identify jungle animals through story telling . i jungle exploration for kids with captain maverickhow to identify the various amazonian animals maverick kids i enjoy !,104,7
Kindle_Store,B00DYG88QA,this book has a story that i am looking forward to reading with my grandchildren . great illustrations and informative content . highly recommend this book for anyone who loves cats,28,8
Kindle_Store,B00DYG88QA,tiger the cat tells a story about all his big cat relatives . if you want to know about all the different big cats [ not house cats ] then this is a very good written book for explaining each one . there is a lot of good facts about them . the only downfall i found was reading it on a kindle without the color does not do the pictures justice .,66,9
Kindle_Store,B00DYG88QA,"i love books like this that go through all the different types of an animal to show you how they are related . this is a great book for any kid who is interested in cats , both small and large . my wife loves cats we once had nine ! and she especially enjoyed the pictures and text about the different kinds of cats . this is a keeper .",65,10

Kindle_Store,B00DYG88QA,"i read this book with my son and he really enjoyed all the great pictures of the big cats . it was good for him to learn the different names for all these related cats , his favourite is still the tiger although !",41,13
Kindle_Store,B00DYG88QA,"alice cusser has created a heart warming picture book about the big cats of the world seen through the eyes of tiger , an adorable and pampered kitten . this book is a quick and easy read for kids or parents needing to entertain their kids before bed . with easy to view pictures and plenty of facts this book is an easy winner for big cat lovers . in fact this book about big cats does just that !",75,14
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"this seventy page short is a prequel to a series i have not yet read . as an introduction to a longer piece , it had adequate development of the setting and the few characters presented . while passengers and much of the crew were in stasis , those awake monitored the ship as well as the space they traveled through on their way to earth . a routine check alerts the crew to the presence of an object that will nearly intersect their path . the captain is compelled to make a decision to investigate or fly by . the piece was well written and interesting enough to grab my attention . i will continue reading the series .",111,0
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"this is rather medium size story 72 pages than real book , and it is just prelude to full - size tookthe pericles conspiracy . reading the story was quite refreshing experience . nowadays in i - i books there is usually sub - space , itl , black hole passages and more which for me is just easy bypass for interesting problems . it is much more ambitious and harder to write interesting book where action is limited by laws of physics presently known to us . that way it is much harder to create interesting universe , fulfilled with interesting action . there is just no way to make chases through galaxy and more action has to be much more developed to be interesting . and passing in the night satisfies those conditions . mankind is limited to slower than light travels , 500 years colonization means only few colonized planets no further than some amountight years from earth , each passage makes years , not days . still the action set in those conditions is quite believable . this story is good enough for me to read the pericles conspiracy in future . the lack of fifth star is because i think that described meeting with aliens was not quite believableespecially that they left eggs and committed suicide .",200,1
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,this book kept my interest all the way through . in fact i really enjoyed the way the writer made the first encounter with a different species interesting . also it gave an insight on how long term space travel might be like . all i can say is that of you enjoy a good science fiction book you have to read this one . in fact i am planning to read the sequel to it soon .,72,2
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"the star liner pericles was on the gliese to earth run . a run that was some amountight years in length . even at .95c it was a trip of six and a half years in the depths of space . then along came a spider , well in this case it was an almost completely inert alien space craft , bleeding atmosphere and tumbling at .85c into their path . they i the middle crew of pericles had a moral obligation to help the stranded vessel as well as a written directive on handling of first contact with an alien culture . they simply had no idea how earth would deal with the request , the task the aliens had charged the captain and crew with . well written and edited prequel to pericles conspiracy , only about 70 pages long . please be advised that this is the start of a story not the story itself . it definitely gives you a taste of the story . while it is good , be aware of or be prepared to purchase the pericles conspiracy as this is the lead in and is not really stand alone .",183,3
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"i enjoyed this book despite the inconsistencies . a spaceship on a routine flight encounters an alien ship in distress . the captain and crew attempt a rescue , after consulting a manual and contact is made . what happens next is fairly predictable . one thing that annoyed me was the over - simplified and misleading explanations for scientific concepts , such as traveling at light speed and aging . also , at one point in the book the author uses the words ring tone and calls that an ancient term , and then refers to the nsa as a current organization . you can not have it both ways . results : ok . free . do not think too hard .",105,4
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"i found this to be an intriguing introduction to what could be a very promising series . the author develops the characters enough i even in a short prequel to make them both likable and have definite histories that are alluded to and hopefully explained further . the math and physics were well thought out , and totally acceptable for the sci - fi genre it is , so no red flags there . some actions could have used a bit more back story to give them context and set them up , but it was a short introduction so no faults there and maybe the back story will come later . all in all i will definitely read the next installment the pericles conspiracy .",116,5
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"this story is very short and it is well written . if i could afford it , i would buy michael kingswoods next book , the pericles conspiracy and continue enjoying the story . perhaps another time .",33,6
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,fun little short story of interstellar colony ships which literally pass in the night . the writing was a little stilted in places but i enjoyed it .,26,7
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"this story of first contact was a good , quick read that leads very nicely into the authors follow - up work , the pericles conspiracy . i am always interested to see how authors deal with space travel and light speed . do they go the star trek route and say that time remains the same on the ship as it does outside the ship or does time slow down on the ship . kingsmoot opts for staying consistent with physics and saying that time slows down as an object approaches the speed of light . it makes for interesting reading and characters who are much older than they look . passing in the night did it is job and made me want to read the next book . a great read .",122,8
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,it is a good start leading up to a new series . for a short free prequel it is a introduction . it leaves you wanting to know about the story and where it leads . it does what it is supposed to do .,38,9
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,i really enjoyed the story . it definitely ended too quickly .,10,10
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"i enjoyed reading this prequel and found it to be interesting and well - written . what happens when future humans finally encounter intelligent life off - planet ? you will have to read to find out . in fact , i look forward to more from this author . this is more like a novella or a long story and it perfectly sets up the next installment .",58,11
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"i do not usually write reviews , but this book was interesting to me for several reasons . the premise is relatively unique and treated in a unique way . good character development and lacking most of those annoying spelling and grammar errors found in most books of this genre . the science is pretty well grounded and well explained . i liked it , and was encouraged enough to buy the expensive follow - on the pericles conspiracy . you will have to read my review of that book spoilers for you . go ahead and download it , after all , it is free , but be prepared to she shall out for the next installment .",103,12
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"yes , this was a good introduction for later novel . well written but not really a complete story . better writing , proofreading and transitions to sections . please keep up the good writing .",30,13
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"do not know what i expected , but this was not it ! traveling through space on a common run , they get the surprise of their lives , and the lives of every other human in their little part of the universe ! how to handle this became harder when they were given a precious cargo .",51,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003AND1IC,i personally loved the slower ballads . the upbeat songs grab you although . i honestly liked every song on there . drop on by was my favorite ! worth the investment .,28,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003AND1IC,laura bell bundy chin and shakin is a very solid debut album . it includes 6 songs for the chin side and 6 songs for the shakin side . she sounds great on this ad and should have a long career in country music .,42,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003AND1IC,"i rarely write music reviews but i had to after buying this train wreck of an album . i really like her first release giddy on up when i can listen to it without picturing the horrific video she made for it . but this album is seriously bad . the lyrics lack substance and the music lacks depth . i had high expectations for this album but there are only two good tracks : giddy on up and boyfriend which is not country at all . i do not consider myself to be that critical when it comes to music , and of course music is subjective , but i was very disappointed . my advice is to save your money . this was some amount of money when i bought it and even at that price i think it was a waste of money . sorry to any laura bell bundy fans .",138,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,i have been listening to more and more comedy . i think patton oswald is brilliant . his style is very rapid fire and high energy . his delivery is a cool juxtaposition of energy of delivery and cynical humor . i really enjoy his work .,41,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"oswaltsome amounting david cross , releases a lot of similar cos ; has a strong fanbase , but many will not care for him in a ad - sized dose . i find his material repetitive . for whatever , reason , i find some other comics who have a lot of complaints to register bill burr , tommy johnagin , and more funnier and more varied in their content .",56,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,patrons humor may not be for everyone but i really like this guy . extremely creative humor that just gets me cracking up time after time . patton is an extremely creative storyteller and is a wonderful entertainer .,36,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"coming off of i patton oswald : my weakness is strong did / ad combo i patton is back with brand new album that covers everything from his new life as a dad to his renewed views on ufc famous bowls . compared to his previous albums , this is much more focused on the daily minutia of life , and less so on any political or nerdy subjects that were covered more in - depth on his previous albums . the changes of his life that is his fatherhood have really come through on his comedy , and honestly , he is still just as funny as he ever has been . i listened to this album with a number of my closest friends , and there were quite literally times where we were having problems breathing we were laughing so hard . the ham incident is hands down one of the funniest things i have heard in a long time . fans of patton oswald should not give this one a second thought and buy it , but those of you on the fence will find this album to be one of patrons most approachable and funniest yet .",181,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"note : i am a huge fan of mr. oswalds standup comedy . i do not know him nor am i a friend of his trying to help promote sales . this album is very funny , it does not disappoint . patton oswald is at the peak of his game here . his wordplay , imagery and insights are top notch as always . finest hour had me laughing so uncontrollably at times i was beginning to worry about my present mental condition . i hope that if you do buy this album that you would enjoy it as much as i do .",95,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,always great for outside the box of boxes thinking ! what i like best is that patton understands his own oddities and does not back down from them ! embraces the overweight star wars nerd that lurks inside each of usor does not !,41,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"basically in short how i like reviews to be the beginning of the album is great , middle not so much , rest of middle to the ending amazing ! i cried of laughter for the ham incident and the horror of new york city . not the best patton album but very good . can not wait for the next one !",56,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"i am coming from the angle of a king of queens fan point of view . and i always knew patton was a stand up comedian , but i never really checked him out . thankfully i did , this is actually funny . i have gone on to get a few more of his albums , and this is the one i listen to the most . very funny .",63,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,this album is great . very happy with the mp3 version . quick and easy to my computer . easy to transfer to the car .,22,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"simply put , patton oswald is the best stand up comedian working today , and this set is clever and painfully hilarious . perhaps not actually his finest hour i would give that to werewolves and lollipops , but close enough to be more than worth your time .",43,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"glad i bought it . patton oswald is my favorite working comedian . i was a bit disappointed in his last ad , my weakness is strong , which i did not believe up to the level of werewolves and lollipops , but i think this one is a bit stronger . he shows no signs of slowing down . what i like the most about him , other than his voices , is that his moral compass comes showing through his jokes , whether he means it to or not . by this point , simply hearing that patton oswald has come out with a new ad is enough to get me to click over and buy it without asking too many questions .",111,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"patton really takes his stand - up to another level with this special . the layering of material and his ever - broadening subject matter almost insure that you will need to hear the whole thing a second time just to soak in all subtle references and jokes he throws out . my only complaint , which is not really the fault of the album or patton , is that this ad does not double as a did . there are some bits to this ad that i am certain would be even funnier in watching them performed and really , i just want to go see a patton oswald stand - up show . all around this is a fantastic stand - up well worth the money and several listenthroughs .",115,14

Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,"i do not know , but for me the story was pretty unbelievable as for the characters i was not that invested in them , i was happy that jason and kay made appearances . it seemed others really liked it so it seems my taste varies from the norm .",45,2
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,nacelle i just want you to know you are one of my favorite interracial authors . it took me a day in a half to read this book . i loved the story . i have read all your books . your stories are wonderful . i hope we get another story soon . do not keep us waiting to long . for those who are hesitate to get this book please do it is worth it to me .,71,3
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,"wow i loved this story ! i would definitely recommend this story if you have previously read kay and jason story , you will recognize these characters from that book . now if you have not read any previous books from this author , i would still recommend this book as a stand - alone , it was that good ! enjoy",54,4
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,"wow ! what can i say , i never write reviews but for this book i had to . when i say nacelle has done it again . from start to finish this book had me wondering what was going to happen next . i could not put this book down finished it in one day . great read . can not wait for what has gon na come next .",57,5
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,just one word for me . awesome . i just hope we see more about the couple really soon . loved seeing kay and jason in this book too .,25,6
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,"i read barely breathing this weekend and i was so there ! my heart bled for john and johnny so much . i wanted to break my foot off in amy behind . she was sooo wrong on so many different levels and all of that was not about her alcohol problem . john is confused and his heart has been damaged soo much by amy . sophia and cara stole my heart . i felt their love and sophia pain and fear . sophia had so much inner strength to endure what she went through and still be able to love and trust . i love how jason and kay were there for john , amy and sophia . they used their own situation to help their friends navigate a touchy and dangerous road . i cried as i always do when reading nacelles books . the realism and the connection i feel makes me feel as if it is my story .",151,7
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,"john and sophia have known each other for awhile , but one situation caused them to really get to know and love one another . after facing many struggles over the course of their relationship , they found strength in each other .",39,8

Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,"i highly recommend this book as there is a good balance of angst , romance , suspense and hea . nacelles stories are enjoyable and keep my attention always read them in one sitting .",31,10
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,this is a different story . the two main characters know each other but are not interested in each other and are even in other relationships . how their circumstances change puts an interesting twist on a romance plot . i think it is a good read .,43,11
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,this was an awesome book . i love that john went for what he knew was right . i can not give to much away but there is dramasome amountove and more drama and a lot of love . i have read all of nacelle books and they never disappoint . great book . looking forward to the next book .,54,12
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,i really enjoyed this novel . it had real life situations and choices that are seen as betrayal by some and truth by others . sometime we are with the wrong person for the right reasons . the heart is the absolute truth when it comes to unconditional love and friendship . sophia and john were meant to be together . i do not agree with how it started but totally understand the conflicting emotions they had . what amy did was so hurtful and selfish . she really did not get it . i highly recommend this story . beware that there is adultery and abortion involved . these things i am totally against but still enjoyed the story .,107,13
Kindle_Store,B00F02NV8G,this was my first time reading this author and i must say this was a good read . i would like to read more about sophia also known as ashley . loved her,29,14

Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,"cute story but should have been longer . have read this author before and thought her works were good ; but with grammar and punctuation errors , not to mention the fact that the main characters name changed from flint to wyatt and back again several times during the book , i doubt if i will read any more of her stuff . the errors are just too distracting to make a good read . i will not be recommending her to anyone and strongly suggest she go back and re - read and edit this piece .",87,0
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,this is a fun read . but too short but it wrapped up nicely . only gripe ? my name is meredith i oh well .,21,1
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,"this was a good book except it was edited very well ! half way through the book the main male characters name was changed from flint to wyatt . then back to flint . also , who names there son britons in the old west ? sounds like a sissy name . but it had good potential .",51,2
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,very disappointed that it was continued at the end . i will not be buying any more of her books . it was a good read but that put me off .,28,3
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,a good short story about the love of family and romance of a mail order bride for her husband and his family,22,4
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,ok to short story is great for the length but think it could have been longer . enjoyed the plot very much .,21,5
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,"the story was pretty good , but it must not have been proof read or edited , as his name changed from flint to wyatt then back to flint and so on .",29,6
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,not worth a free book that you only get once a month . was like reading from a young teenager point of view,22,7
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,"story line was a good read . very disappointed in writing . in several chapters , the main male characters name was incorrect . had to reread to figure out what was going on .",30,8
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,ugh is all i can think to say ! this very boring . i finished it hoping it would get better it only got worse .,22,9
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,"i have read books from this author before and although they are short , there usually a very nice quick read . but this book had me wanting all i money back , mid way through the book flints name changed and kept changing back and forth i was confused . this book was so disappointing",50,10
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,terrific story but wish it was longer . i have read other books by this author and have enjoyed every one of them,22,11
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,always a good read from cia leaheveryone reading this will enjoy,13,12
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,i have read lot cia leah books this was also real good only one part of the book they kept calling flint wyatt which was real confusing would recommend to other i,31,13
Kindle_Store,B00JL89VB6,this was a great short story and i enjoyed reading . this story showed how different people can work together and have a happy life together .,25,14
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,we have all been fan girls or fanboys at some point . but this goes beyond a crush and develops into something sweeter . it is not a terribly profound story nor is it too superficial . manages to strike a balance with a simple storyline .,41,0
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"a bit of a story or dream sequence , the rugby jock and the fan . mostly story and interaction between the two . a bit of sex , and even less character development .",30,1
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"great book like the authors writings , will read more of them as i can . have read other books by her and was happy to read them ,",26,2
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"the first half of this book was all soccer and stalking and that is literally it . the two did not even meet until at the a percentage mark . the flow was quite awkward as although the novel was not edited . unless you love soccer , this one is a pass .",46,3
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"this short story had much to recommend it . thorough and seemingly to me ; i am quite uneducated about the sport accurate inclusion of rugby , undeniable attraction between robin and yves , believable motivation from robin as he has the only character whose head we were in . the i or i romance was handled very tastefully . the sex scenes were graphic but brief and did not overwhelm the plot . the plot was so very well done , especially for a short story ! robins admiration of a very attractive yves playing rugby the manliest of sports showcasing his physique and musculature and overall male hotness makes me want to go to a rugby game !",103,4
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"not for me , i did not realized what it was about but it was not for me that is for sure . sorry .",20,5
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"this one was recommended to me by a good findsome amounted i listened . it is a short , sassy read . the main character is quirky and fun and his crush on the rugby star is adorable . it brings me back to those days of being quasi - obsessed with someone . we have all been there . this author captures all those feelings of uncertainty , thinking that that person will just never notice you , and wondering what things could be like if they did . you have to see how this one turns out . it is action packed and fun - spirited !",91,6
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,it is not about rugby by gay romance !,8,7
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"this was a very sweet , very sexy story . i enjoyed reading it , even although there were a few points that lagged . the inclusion of rugby was interesting , but it felt like the author was more focused on featuring the sport itself than the romance plot . a fun and light read , but do not expect to be knocked off your feet .",59,8
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"i loved this short story , it flowed well , the characters are memorable , and in the end it all made sense . i love when books make sense . robin was super cool !",30,9
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"i am a fan of mrs. singer and bought this with no pause deleted it from my kindle without the same pause . you have 2 main characters who are nice but nothing really outstanding to really grab you and keep you in the book . it is short and not a lot happens . i read it last month to be honest do not remember much about it . i definitely will not be re - reading this book as i have her on the mountain series on call series , they are both worth the time and effort .",92,10
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"writing is awkward , with mental thoughts intended to be clever or witty becoming distracting and trite . better skip this , even although it is short .",23,11
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"this book has nothing to do with scrum style agile software development . word abuse . i assumed it was and since it was free downloaded it to my kindle without bothering to read more about it . i mean , free says take a look .",42,12
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,i had hoped for more excitement and explosive intensity with such a prolonged build up to the intimate moment between sebastian and robin . definitely disappointed .,25,13
Kindle_Store,B00HNSLKTW,"my only complaint is that i wish this was longer , at the very least the mini marathon would have been nice to see . i love the slight twist in the story felt like this would happen but i was still pleasantly happy when it did . i would recommend this short story to anyone who asked .",57,14
Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,"could be a good series , but this author makes a lot of errors that are not edited and corrected .",18,0
Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,this is one book in a series by sara robbins that you can not seem to get enough of . good clean romantic mystery that keeps you guessing around every turn . warning : you will get addicted so if you buy this one you have to buy them all,46,1

Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,i enjoyed reading all three aspen valley inn books ! fun and light . i read them quickly and am looking forward to a fourth .,23,4
Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,it read like a ladies home journal story of the month it passed the time but the characters were one dimensional,21,5
Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,i found this to be a very intriguing book . i enjoyed it very much . love sara robbins writings . great reading,20,6

Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,i am enjoying the whole series . i was finished before i realized it and started on a second set of sarah books . it is easy to relate to the inn and events center and the mysteries are great !,36,11

Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,she is very good at writing a mystery . you never know who it is until the end . will get more of her books .,23,13
Kindle_Store,B00CIA5T06,i enjoy this series of books by sara robbins . i think you will find them entertaining .,16,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"i was surprised how good this release was . fogerty touches on several styles here , including the bouncy 70s - style blues - rocker headlines ala bad company . the pumping bassline is infectious . knockin on your door is pure 60s - style soul , spiced up by a punchy horn section . change in the weather is a sultry blues - rocker with a funky groove . another version of this tune can be found on buddy guys feels like rain ad , where he teams up with country - rocker travis trite . things start to slip a bit with violence is golden , a scathing anti - war track . although it has a biting chorus , the rest is oddly mellow awkward . was not that a woman is just as trite as it sounds . even worse is soda pop , a complete waste of 5:53 . sail away is a so - so finale . some may be put off by the opening instrumental , goin back home . the track opens with a choir - like keyboard intro , followed by a slow , bluesy guitar toward the end . personally , i like it .",165,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"john fogerty 3rd solo album eye of the zombie 73 , is a much rockier effort than his comeback album in 1985s centerfold . john says he does not really care much for this release anymore , but i still find it a very good rock roll release . it produced a hit single with the title trackside amounting to 81 on the hot 100 and 3 on the mainstream rock chart , it also scored with change in the weather 3 mainstream rock and headlines 27 mainstream rock , other favorites include sail away , as close to a car tune as you can get , violence is golden , some sharp guitar on this one and the funk of was not that a woman . soda pop , might be the only weak tune here , but i can tolerate it . great lost album by mr. john fogerty . due to johns drinking at the time , he does not care much for this album .",150,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,great value . if you remember the 60s and 70s you will love this one .,14,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"this album is worth owning , since appearently physically buying the ad is the only way to acquire it rather than by download , that i could find , i am sure due to the legendary squabbling over the creedence rights . still it is worth the bother . recommend change in the weather for the groove and the whole album for the songwritingsome amounted , not great , but a must have for any serious creedence or fogerty fan . on the whole i rank it better than centerfold , personally .",80,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,i bought it on vinyl when it first came out and have played it for years until my needle on my player came out . i got to get it on ad !,30,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,i had this in a cassette and now i can hear it on ad in my car . it is a great ad i would suggest this to anyone that likes c.c.r.,31,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,i like eye of the zombie . john fogerty is my favorite singer !,12,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,i think something bad must have happened in his life before he made this album . very depressing .,17,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,it is fantastic ! i really enjoy john fogerty alone or with creedence clearwater revival . it is to bad he has gone . but his music will live on !,24,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"at the time , it was great to hear anything by the guy , and since i am a big fan of his pretty much anything he puts out i am going to like to some event . i liked this better when this first came out , despite it is somewhat bitter tone . but it does not age very well for me . he tried to go for the modern sound at the time , which meant using drum machines and synthesizers . so it sounds very dated to me . there are good songs on here although ; change in the weather , sail away and headlines hold up .",97,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,loved this ad when i first heard it in 86 . sounds awesome . used in a greatest hits ad i made for my dad . he loves it .,26,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"there was some good , very different stuff for fogerty on this album , but also too many pretty bad songs . the title song eye of the zombie was just awful . while going back home , and change in the weather were quite good , and knockin on your door and especially was not that a woman were fun steps into old time soul music . the others were , i am going to examples of some of the tuneless and lyrically uninteresting songs he was putting out during this period .",81,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"this is an album that was heavily criticized on it is day . it tries to distance from the car sound and to get a modern sound in tune with the 80s . even of himself does not play songs from this album live . but i think is a good album , eye of the zombie is a killer song , change in the weather , headlines are cool songs too . soda pop tries to be a dance song with a funky sound , if you like funk like me this could be refreshing . this version i bought is actually a high definition ad , and the sound obviously is remarkable . a misunderstood album and of course centerfold is much better than this . but i think this one has a grain of it is own . enjoy",126,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,enjoyed the ad when i should have bought the album 20 years ago . i remain a big fan of johnfogerty as i was his band creedence clearwater.revival . a totally befuddled reverend al nunnally i frankfurt saw me sit and use headlinesand other tunes by john fogerty as i cut off and got rid of the group chicago . john fogerty remains a favorite artist .,63,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"i bought this disc primarily for one song , change in the weather . it was worth it . unlike his blue moon swamp album , where he skips the political and environmental crap in favor of extremely well written and performed songs , eye of the zombie sounds angry and lacks the fogerty magic on most of the songs . the title track is a good song , but change in the weather may well be one johns best songs , with plenty of the old creedence clearwater revival sound and feel , and an extended jam reminiscent of cars version of i heard it through the grapevine . why this track has never been included in a greatest hits package borders on the criminal . the remastered version of eye of the zombie has sound that is superior to the original ad release and if you like spooky , swampy music , you may well enjoy it .",146,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"i love western movie themes and this ad has some of the best that were ever made , i also like that amazon has these items for sale .",26,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"i have only listened to 1 song from this ad , so feel free to mark this review negatively . but the other one - star review here on amazon should be heeded i these are re - recordings . the song i listened to on pandora is entitled once upon a time in the west and is based on tunes from that soundtrack . but the actual first half is from the piece as a judgment and the second half is based on the films overture . both halves are re - done , and while not horrible , have lost a lot of power . the original as a judgment , in particular , is a masterpiece so buy the original soundtrack ! if you do not know these songs , you may be safe buying this ad because you will not be disappointed by the comparison . still , i wonder how badly the other tunes have been mangled when re - recorded ? i would not take the risk of buying this ad unless i would heard it entirely not just amazon samples .",159,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"i enjoy listening to these , and recapturing nostalgic feelings of the mythical old west . a real variety . especially like the magnificent seven and true grit . it would have been nice too , to have the theme from ken burns the west , as that is based on native american chantsjust a thought .",52,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"these cos were actually for my sister , but i have gotten to enjoy hearing them as well . they have an amazing selection , and have provided hours of enjoyment .",28,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"please note if you are considering buying that these are not the original movie soundtracks , these are an orchestra re - recording the music . ifsome amounting me , you like the original thing , then this is not for you .",36,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,what a great way to drive your re down the backroads of the southwest imagining your on a horse heading for your next adventure . the music is great and with deep sounds and perfect instrumentation . simply beautiful music .,37,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"this album is great , but heres what you need to know about it : all of the music is performed by the prague philharmonic orchestra . it is not from any of the original sources . so the bonanza theme song is not exactly the same as what you hear in the to show opening . and the guy singing the song from high noon is good , but it is not the same guy who sings the song in the movie . just be aware that this is a compilation of the music , but not from the original sources . some great western songs are missing . for example , they have a great medley of the music from the searchers , one of the greatest westerns ever made , and the medley really makes any fan of the movie appreciate how well done the score was , but it does not include the actual theme song from the searchers what makes a man to wander ? . it includes some themes that could just as well have been left off . i know , that is my personal opinion , but not every track on this set is a winner . so long as you know that , it is a fun album .",192,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"i actually got this for my dad as a present since he loves western movies . but i actually really like it too . i started listening to the music everyday after i got it because i liked it so much , and so does my dad . so bottom line , if you like western movies you will like this ad .",57,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"received this set as a christmas present and am thoroughly enjoying it . the collection is made up of new arrangements not performed by the original artists but for the most part the arrangements are fairly faithful to the source material . there are a couple of real gems in the mix . the tracks are alphabetically sorted by film title which is kind of helpful . the one downside is that the solo vocalist used on the tracks that require one gunfight at ok corral for instance sounds like he is delivering an operatic performance , which does not work all that well to my ears . he has a great voice , but it is just the wrong type of delivery .",114,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"this 4 disc rendition of 100 western movie soundtrack themes is ok . my fault in final analysis because i was looking for original sound tracks and although the renditions done are pretty good , hearing another singer do ok corral or high noon other than frankie lane or tex ritter is just not getting the job done . the instrumental cuts although not original are still good . another disc is coming in mid march which states it is all original and i will check that one out . last , some of the cuts selected are not distinct in terms of deserving a notice as a western theme to be included . with 100 cuts you are going to get some added as filler content and for me that is what happened . last and last , it notes that dimitri timein is the composer but it is the prague orchestra who does the arrangements and plays the music . again , not original .",154,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"i was looking for elmer einsteins magnificent seven theme music to enhance preparatory lessons for my students before they attended the symphony . i ran across this and it has been playing in my car ever since . for those cowboy movie or to show lovers who were around since the 50s , this is a good mental reminder . the musicality of the performances is very good as well .",64,10

Kindle_Store,B00HQLF9N4,ok i loved book 1 2 but 3 did not do it for me it was all action revenge and fake deaths there was very little love story the ending was rushed that avion sunshine incident was rushed it happened so fast . all over the place,48,4
Kindle_Store,B00HQLF9N4,"i was happy to see this book come out . i have been waiting to see what ace and the crew would get into . ok . maybe because i am not use to this type of storyline a few things had me shacking my head . for starters i do not really know why this is in the romance category . maybe that is the norm , but there were like three love scenes in this book . then the story itself was so full of crazy and unnecessary drama that the explanations at the end just fell flat . it could have been less drama with a more believable ending and it still would have been good . i was happy with the end but i just feel like it was too late to make up for the very busy body of the story . lastly , the editing once again was horrible . it really does take away from the flow of the story , and when you are already semi disappointed in what you are reading it sucks even more . well i still love amir , jay and the boys and i am glad jay had a bigger part this time but i am not so thrilled with the story itself . so 3 1/2 maybe 4 stars for this final installment .",200,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"this ad , which is at least the 3rd collection of theirs , is really pretty good , but roughly the same as the others . i remember when i first got this , i expected more of an enya sound , since she does have family in planned . but this actually is not so much new age , as it is some traditional and pop . alot sounds more like the corps or secret garden , than it does enya . still very good of course . smooth , mellow , and mostly relaxing . one thing i do not understand is why my favorite song i will find you theme from last of the mohicans is not on here , or any other collection . that is only on baba , as far as i know . overall this is a very nice listen , just fairly interchangeable with everything else they have done .",134,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"like other reviewers here , i first knew about this group through their i will find you sound track . i went out and bought the ad , and glad i did . i then bought few more of cannady , but nothing matched this one . this is a unique album that was made with passion . as a whole , it is very romantic . there is something enigmatic about a song with lyrics i do not understand , yet the music tells it all . those tracks with english words are simply beautiful , almost poetic . i have worn out my ad copy like the other reviewer , and am in need to buy a new one .",105,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"yes , there are seven cuts in common between this album and rocha , and yet each ad does have it is own sound . this makes this an excellent introduction to the group , planned , as also is rocha . the difference , as has been mentioned in another review , is that this compilation presents the groups absolute essential cuts along with great cuts that emphasize the newer new age facet of their work , while if you are looking for stronger celtic flavor , you would prefer the other one . those that are , miho , the strongest new age and best are scarlet inside , the wild cry really great instrumentation here , turning tide bird like warbling and strong dramatic sense , and the concluding number , many roads .",117,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,it was not what i expected . why is there a word requirement ? that is ridiculous and a waste of my time,21,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"regardless of the decade these songs were created in , they are timeless . the entire blend is a wonderful one i the instrumentals are very well done , the vocals and harmony are enchanting haunting at the same time . the music is both relaxing and or or invigorating as well i depending on your mood . i enjoy this ad when driving , resting , or during my own artistic efforts . in fact , a creative person may find , as i have , that these melodies enhance the creative process . this music blends effortlessly with your life , enhancing it . the melodies make you want to sing with them . i can not recommend this ad highly enough . if you like ethereal , celtic or irish music this ad is a must for your collection .",121,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,let us hear some new releases . i think this group has been resting on their laurels long enough . time for some new songs folks !,23,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"music has to do with personal taste and preferences and planned has always been one of mine but this particular ad was ideal . it had a lovely combination of their hits , including many of the songs from british fans of the robin hood series seen here in america on showtime back in the 90s . the lovely celtic sound is timeless and enchanting and one i never tire of .",68,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"i love celtic music and i am a fan of planned but this album does not do much for me . most of the vocal pieces seem very modern albeit with celtic themes running through them . the instrumental pieces fit my notion of celtic much better . the quality of the recordings is good but the quality of the music is fair , unless this type of fusion is what you are looking for . then have at it .",75,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,i love cannady history especially when the now named enya was the soprano . i love harry game especially and bought the album for this song .,25,14

Kindle_Store,B000FC14DU,"mediocre is the best definition for scottolines work . this novel is not her worst , but does not really represent an exception . scottolines grasp of italian culture and history is ridiculously approximate and stereotyped . her lady - lawyer characters are both boring and annoyingly human , correct and funny in the writers intention . psychology : zero . law : zero . plot : why , if you really do not have anything else to read but the yellow pages and this book , i would advise you to go for the vendetta defence .",82,6

Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007B1C3,"a lot of fluff and advertising . the only interesting part for me is the articles from don casey and nigel calder , and more that reply to peoples questions about maintenance , and more",30,0
Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007B1C3,i thought this would be a great way to learn about boats in general but it stays true to sailboats and all of them are very very expensive .,28,1
Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007B1C3,"sail magazine is a ten - minute read then toss it . i cancelled it after a year . look , my opinion is just my opinion . almost all magazines today are almost all advertising ; either overt ads , or covert advertising disguised as articles and reviews about new products . i spent ten minutes every issue reading a few columns written by famous names such as nigel calder et . al and that was it . i have read their books for the most part anyway , so these few useful parts were not worth the some amount of money a year subscription fee , so i cancelled it . your mileage may vary . but advertising can be informative if read with discrimination , especially if you are new to the sport and want to get an overview of what has going on commercially . i am old enough to remember when the americas cup was a contest between boats and sailors , not between computers and lawyers , so my viewport may be very different from yours . fair winds .",160,2

Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007B1C3,"fairly good magazine . the articles are short , interesting , and often include sailing stories . sail could use more hands on information . overall evenly balanced between stories of interest , and how to articles . sail seems to be targeted at the middle class boat owner . you may need to subscribe to a mag more focused on your particular needs or two to three magazines on sailing .",63,12

Kindle_Store,B006GNXPJI,"i enjoyed this book . you realize how much you enjoy a book when you find yourself at work watching the clock because you can not wait to get home and continue reading ! especially if you are not normally an avid reader . from the beginning , i got right into it . i was fascinated by the main characters abilities , insight , courage and above all alas heart . can not wait to read the next one .",70,0

Kindle_Store,B006GNXPJI,"i am a sci - fi fan , and as such , i am quite fussy when it comes to one of my favorite genres . this book did not disappoint at all . the characters in the story are unique , they all have their own personalities and reactions to every situation . they all blend together well , and help make the story believable and interesting , as well as keeping the reader guessing . the novel was very well written and it works very well to draw the reader in . within the first few chapters the reader finds themself rooting for the main character kala , and that feeling does not dissipate at all during the novel . i really enjoyed this novel , it was well crafted and engaging , and i am looking forward to read what comes next .",125,4
Kindle_Store,B006GNXPJI,"i will give any new author a try if they have a free book . i thought this was a bit slow and disjointed at the start and the book also had some very glaring grammar or editing errors . i also was disappointed by the ending , it feels rushed and leaves you with the task of tying the name of the book to what the end result is . once i got into the book it flowed pretty well and kept me interested . however , overall this book needs a much better editing and the ending needs to be totally re - written .",95,5

Kindle_Store,B006GNXPJI,i found this as a free book after activating my kindle app on my android device . i was not sure what to expect . i just wanted to find a new sci - fi story and i am a big fan of series . i was sucked in from the first chapter . the story is well written and engaging . several times i was on the edge of my seat . there are some issues that can be cleared up with editing but it did not distract from the story . i will be picking up the second in the series soon .,91,7

Kindle_Store,B006GNXPJI,"rate 9.0 / 10.0 i really enjoyed reading this sci - fi novel even although i am not really in sci - fi . first of all , the book cover attracted me . as always being said by people , a picture tells a thousand words . this book is no exception . true enough , as i flipped from the first page to the last page , i was captivated the way the author illustrated the characters . it was so engaging . i really like plot which is full of surprises , thrilling moments that at times caught me off guard . the character , kala is well - developed with a sense of purpose . i was amazed how she tries to push for her peace - keeping efforts despite the was is in progress . without giving too much away , as i read chapter 3 , i noticed that kala was in a solemn state of mind whereby she was about to meet her master . there is something kala will face on here onwards . you have to read it to find out more . this book is the first book of a series of 3 novels , and to me . it is really a good start , i would expect more good stuff for this series . i can not wait to read more of this author sci - fi works .",204,9
Kindle_Store,B006GNXPJI,"it is hard to forgive typographical and grammatical errors in a purely electronic format . suddenly switching tense and voice in the final two chapters as well as the preview was both i shall - advised and jarring for the reader . it simply did not make sense . and the story was simply incomplete . there was not a cliffhanger , it just ended . it was like a class assignment that had to reach a certain number of pages . rather than finish the scene , the author just stopped . and there should have been much more description of the alien races and cultures . are xenon and estonian the same species ? they both have two hearts so . what started the war ? what do they look like ? what about the other races ? how did the cybernetics start ? some background and narrative is necessary . i liked the plot and characters . and stuck with it to the end of the book . but i will not bother with the rest of the story . i felt like i was reading someone has homework from a creative fiction course .",169,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000DCWE,"just recently picked this one up sight unseen , and am very pleased . a traditional yet fresh sound , with simple but solid songwriting . sounds like mick taylor - era stones crossed with the smithereens , infused with perhaps a small dose of cracker . it also in spots reminds me of the early 70s hugh nicholson band blue . and the packaging art paying homage to one of the greatest fiction mags in american history is designed to catch the discerning eye . very likeable effort that shows a lot of promise for development .",87,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000DCWE,"a great ad cover lives up to the coolness . i do not even know what year i bought this ad , it is like i have had it forever . i can not even remember the motivation behind the purchase . suffice to know that if you enjoy the americana music style , or pop with hints of country and blues and rock . really it is everything beautifully concocted in a tonic so delicious you will not care what to call it . this is such a marvelous ad i will simply say , if you are here reading this review and poking about wondering what to buy this is a guaranteed winner . it is probably better than the derivatives bands that created it . it includes a few different vocal styles each wonderful and a few song style approaches that vary modestly and are exquisite in execution . wow that is a wordy little explanation but it moves me and i hope you will give it a try too . this is a worthy ad and a beautiful addition to any varied collection of americana music .",168,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"this band is not tool , they will not ever be . it is a good ad , but it is kind of stereotypical for everyone to label them as being tool rip offs . the fact of the matter is , the lyrics are not as deep as maynard , nor will they ever be . the musical talent is there , but it is different than adam , danny , and justin . look at the drummer for earshot , not even in the same league with danny carey , nor has he been trained as extensively . that should tell it right there .",87,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"earshot has a great single in get away but another than that song , the album just falls short . it was very disappointing to hear , especially when the single gave the band so much promise . i will admit the fact that his voice sounds like a fetal maynard james keenan although lacking variety and power is a very good feature about this band . but other than that , they just do not have what it takes . the rest of the album is very repetitive and mediocre at best . maybe this band has a future , maybe they do not . the single shows promise , what they do after this will show everyone what kind of a band they really are .",114,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"this band is alright . not really my type of music , but alright . i only bought the ad because i was told it sounded very similar to tool . i tried really hard to hear the similarity , but found them to sound much more like chappelle . i really do not see how people can say this sounds like tool at all . they are different in just about every way possible . they are lacking as far as lyrical meaning . i was not impressed , whereas tools lyrics seem to lick my soul . there are i believe some amountuitarists in this band , so even structurally they are far off from tool . for all who keep saying this band sounds like tool , just stop . although i am sure this band is flattered by it , they probably want their own identity . and to compare them to a band as musically evolved as tool is just ignorant .",146,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"i read the reviews before i picked up this ad and found that everyone compared this band to footwell , i do not know why as what i heard was a band creating their own style . the only similarity to tool is by having a singer who can actually sing , and more figured features to the songs ploy also tried by other good artists such as linkin park , amongst others . earshot has succeeded where the others failed the singer can actually sing ! songs like get away , ordinary girl and this world prove that there are actually some great singers getting out there , as well as the songs themselves being catchy which tool are powell , not as much anyways and well written , with hooks and changes in all the right places . recommended to all those looking for talent in their music .",144,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"i kept hearing about how this band called earshot was so much like tool , and since i am a huge tool fan , i decided to pick it up . letting go is a pretty good album , and the more i listen to it , the more it grows on me . why this group has gotten negative press for being tool wannabes baffles me , however . there are a couple of songs that sound very much like tool get away , wake up , and my time , but there are hints of other bands as well . born , for instance , and if you listen , there are some stark similarities to linkin park in these songs as well . in fact , i would say that overall they are more like linkin park than tool . all bands are influenced by someone who came before them , so i do not see what the big deal is . anyway , the album is good . there has a lot of variety in the pace of the songs similar to tool there . i gave it three stars , but it is really been growing on me , and i would say it is 3 stars at least . if you like music like linkin park , born , tool , disturbed , and more , then i would pick this one up too . brian h.",202,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"but still entertaining as can be . i like this album a lot , but it is not what i thought it was going to be when i bought it . the excellent track get away is the closest to tool that they get , which disappointed me tool being the best band in existence , but i like that they have their own style and sound . this album is relatively short , which is also another dissapointment . other than that i say give this a shot . their sound is strong , and the singers voice can be powerful sort of like maynard from aforementioned musical gods tool and also fragile , which is a good quality . go ahead and purchase this relatively cheap and valuable ad .",119,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"when i first reviewed this album two years ago , i gave it a glowing reviews . unfortunately , the album does not have too much lasting value . they initially impressed me due to the vocalists similarity to maynard james keenan , but the novelty of that wore thin quickly . the band does not have too much aside from that to back them upsome amounteaving a rather average nu - metal band . if they worked at developing a more unique sound , there has definite potential for greatness . but as of this record , that potential is far from fulfilled .",89,13

Kindle_Store,B00DQLWDDW,"although the storyline has potential , the lack of proper punctuation and grammar is a big deterrent . this author is in serious need of an editor , just in the first two lines i spotted at least 2 missing commas and two missing question marks . please get an editor as soon as possible .",48,10

Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"this prequel provides the background information to the relationships presented in firelight . however , callahan exhibits the same strong writing as she uses in her full length novels . centering on a strong male and a stronger female , ember is almost poetic in it is descriptions of lord archer struggling with his grotesque physical deformity , and of miranda torturing herself with guilt . with unusual characters , vivid descriptions , and a realistic plot i except for the supernatural elements i this could be a story of real life in victorian london . it is a tale of strugglesome amountove and betrayal of the worst sort .",99,0
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"an excellent balance of historic setting , intrigue and magic to wet the appetite for the full length series opener . well worth the some amount of money price . a penny a page . can not wait to find out who does what , and how it all tangles together .",41,1
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"ember , a prequel for firelight , answers questions readers may have been wondering about . for instance , readers learn why miranda and martin never married and what happened the night miranda sealed her familys fate . the back and forth between miranda and lord archer was great because it was like seeing what each was doing at about the same time . i loved how both miranda and archer meant more to each other than they were willing to admit to themselves . after reading ember , i can see why miranda and archers relationship was so explosive . ember also helps explain some of the worries that the characters have in firelightsome amounting why miranda so reluctant to use her power . i am glad i waited until after reading firelight to read ember . i already knew who the characters were to each other and whenever the characters said something foreshadowing an event in firelight , i knew just what they were talking about . galley provided by netgalley on behalf of forever , an imprint of grand central publishing",169,2
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,i liked this prequel . it was interesting on it is own and it set up the characters so much that i couldnt imagine reading firelight without knowing all the back story .,30,3
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,this tied up the story of miranda and archer . a must read if you enjoyed firelight . i have enjoyed this series and recommend it .,24,4
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,great quick read . loved the prequel to firelight . it explained things so much more to me . now i i ave a greater love for the series .,26,5
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,a good beginning to firelight wish more books had a beginning like this . was able to go right into the story,21,6
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"having won a copy of winterblaze , the third novel of this series i thought to get some background before i began reading it and now i am hooked . this novella teased right from the beginning . a touch of fairy tale , a hint of magic , a dream of a man or is it a monster all swirling around desperation and dangerous pastimes . i hope to find out that miranda and archer grow more attached and not only in their dreams while i am reading firelight , book 1 of the darkest london series .",91,7
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,i really loved this story . i was immediately caught up in it and rooting for both characters . it is nice to have a book where essentially the man and woman both save each other rather than it always being the woman who is rescued .,44,8
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,just when i thought the book was going to get good it ended . left you hanging done understand what the author was trying to do .,25,9
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"a very good story with just the right amount of intrigue , action , paranormal and romance . need to find out what happens next .",22,10
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"ember is a prequel to firelight , the first novel in the darkest london series . it ends with more questions than answers , but definitely sets up the main characters and leaves me wanting more . miranda ability is fascinating , and i look forward to seeing how she learns to utilize and manage it fully . i am also intrigued to discover exactly what is archers curse or malady or disorder . the back and forth in the character pops and the timeline was a bit confusing . i wish the narrative was streamlined in a more linear way to provide better continuity . i did enjoy the foreshadowing in their dreams , and the idea that both characters dreamed of each other after only one meeting . this kindle version suffered from some formatting issues and multiple instances of dropped words resulting in awkward phrasing and sentence structure . would benefit from another round with the copy editor . loses points in that regard , but as far as story content , i am eager to read on .",160,11
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"the time and country and people jumps had me going back to see how much time had passed , if any . enjoyable enough that i have gone to the second book .",30,12
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"i read this after reading the book . the book was more exciting , more mysterious , and kept me turning the pages . had i read this prequel first , i probably would not have continued to read the book .",36,13
Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"for those of us who just could not get enough of archer and miranda in i firelight , there is just a little bit more of their story to share . ember is characterized a prequel novella , but i would consider it more like a companion piece highlighting a string of events leading to archer miranda reunion . most of those events are referenced in firelight , which make them familiar , although enjoyable to read in more detail . we get a closer look at miranda failed engagement and how she met billy , as well as archers trip to egypt and the mexican vision quest that leads him back to london . i do not know how well this will serve for people who have not read the novel yet , but it works well for those of us who have . it is simply missing the most vital part of what makes firelight sing , which is the relationship between archer and miranda in action . still , it is a welcome extra for fans of the series . a little less than 4 stars .",170,14

Kindle_Store,B001B8NWAA,"this was a nice introduction to economics . well written and immediately useful . my only complaint was with the graphs , which were almost completely incomprehensible . this is mainly due to the dummies style of printing only in black and white . other texts would usually use different colours to represent different lines . this may seem like nitpicking , but there is such heavy reliance on graphs in this text that if you can not understand the graph , then you are only getting half the explanation .",81,9
Kindle_Store,B001B8NWAA,"i really liked the examples and explanation , but they were for beginners than intermediary learners or course takers . it should only be used as a reference book to clarify concepts and nothing more . i wish they had made the content suited more to supplement course , but it is again a self - help book for beginners than intermediary or advanced learners course takers . not recommend it for people taking college econ courses since most schools are focus on calc than theory .",80,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"this is one of the most underrated albums of the past twenty years . tony bennett covers most of sinatra best material from the 50s and 60s , and he does not try to musically photocopy franks phrasing or nelson riddles superb orchestrations . this is tony being tony , and that is more than enough . bennett ranks just behind sinatra as the best pop vocalist of the past fifty years . bennett connects with every song , and it makes you wonder what they could have come up with if they did an album together . tons version of one for my baby is absolutely brilliant , and the way he interprets the lady is a tramp must make frank smile approving from his heavenly hall of fame . if you are serious about tons musical body of work , perfectly frank has to be be one of your essential purchases . it was released in 1992 , and it is arguably one of top three or four albums of his career . buy ifsome amountisten to it , and treasure it . this is great music as it is meant to be .",175,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"i am amazed at how few people realize this is one of the best recordings of the later 20th century . this is tony bennett in 1992 at what must be the absolute zenith of his talent . here is tony with an extraordinarily honest , well selected , marvelously sung collection of songs i a superb , deeply entertaining homage to the pack - leader , frank sinatra . let us face it i this recording is very near perfection . if you prize great vocals , if you prize moving - intimate - wonderful - love - songs , if you prize tony , if you prize the real meaning of frank , and if you prize the best lyrics and the greatest melodies , then this is the one recording to own . hands down . perfectly frank is perhaps the quintessential essential recording . buy this several times over i you simply can not go wrong .",132,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"this ad is one of my favourite in my whole collection . tony bennetts voice just gets better and better with age , in fact i much prefer his latter day recordings to his early work , which is the total opposite with someone like frank sinatra who i think made a collection of music in the 40s and 50s that will forever remain unsurpassed by any other singer . but back to this ad : others have reviewed the individual tracks , but what really makes this album for me is the overall feeling . if you want to get the atmosphere of a top notch jazz band with , in my opinion , the greatest living jazz singer , playing in your living room then just buy this ad . it really is like having tony and his band right there with you . the sound is clear , simple and more importantly . wonderful . the songs and the music speak for themselves . buy it !",152,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"one of the previous reviewers said it perfectly i tony bennett is a living national treasure . this album is wonderful not because it seeks to replace sinatra classic recordings that will never happen , but because it shows first of all how sinatra chose the best songs to record , and secondly , that bennetts voice is still magic . the singer wisely focuses on the torch and saloon songs of sinatra , which he delivers and interprets beautifully . it is illuminating to listen to tony bennetts versions of sinatra classics i one for my baby , angel eyes , time after time i and appreciate how he performs the songs while refusing to imitate sinatra . the result is pure class , the glowing tony bennett and some of the best songs in the american songbook . ralph sharon has been working with bennett for decades , and it shows : class , taste and restraint . very highly recommended for anyone who wants to hear a legendary vocalist and songs that put to shame almost anything written since the 1960s .",168,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,tony has done some remarkable stuff in his long career . maybe i am just too enamored with sinatra versions but this album does not ring any bells for me . maybe it is the arrangements . if you are a bennett fan it is probably going to be the greatest .,43,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"this has to be my favorite album they have done . it is just fantastic . the last time i saw them , about 4.5 years ago in san francisco at stinks peep show , spike jumped out in the crowd when they were playing do not cry for me argentina and i jumped on top of everyone and i sang the last bit of the song with him . they are an awesome band to see live ! if i were to buy any of their cos , it would be this one for sure !",88,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"this ad is my all time favorite . me first and the give me gimmes are an awesome band and their twisted covers of old broadway hits are incredible ! they have preserved the good lyrics and writing of these songs but blended in their own punk or rock side of it perfectly . this ad is a definite must have for anybody out there who likes punk , nay , anyone who likes music at all ! get this ad now , you will not regret it !",76,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"spike is a charismatic frontman and it is him that really makes this band , the music being fairly generic bouncy pop - punksome amounting it is members other bands and it is not like novelty cover songs is a new idea in punk . billie joe was in this band at one point , as i think was lou koller from sick of it all . they have been going for years , by the way .",66,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"this time the gimmes cover musical hits ! the sound of music , a chorus line , phantom of the opera , it is the give me gimmes for chrissake ! do we need an explanation ? ! anyway , it rocks and will be in your ad player for months ! best songs are , what i did for love , and raining on prom night . you should get it if you are into good music !",63,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"aside from being beyond hilarious this album simply rocks . worth the price of admission for tomorrow , favorite things , sci - fi double feature and do not cry for me argentina alone not to mention the cover the album should come with a frame . and it is full of interesting punk rock homages such as kicking off favorite things with the intro to bad religions classic lonesome amountenerator . the only song i do not care for is cabaret which i probably misspelled , to boot . better and more fleshed out than their first have a ball and equal to their most recent blow in the wind the i is are the only punk - rock super group that matters !",111,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"all i have to say is that while playing rainbow connection in the stereo system , my fiance took a listen to it , remembering the original , and saying that is awful ! i knew i had a winner . the only reason i say 4 stars and not 5 is that the beloved 5 star rating should be saved for the classics , but 4 is not bad either . not only do they cover the songs well but their clean , crisp style makes it all the more joyous to listen to . but i can imagine the band playing in a bar and having the crowd slam to songs from the movies annie and the muppet movie just because it is a good punk sound .",117,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"your favorite punk cover band comes out loud and proud with some fantastic covers of well known musical tunes . i originally bought it for the rainbow connection cover , but was more than pleased with the rest of the songs as well . a couple of them come out slightly odd if you think about them in the context of the originals . for example , the phantom of the opera song is a duet . but they do not play it like a duties a solo vocal . that is not to say it came out bad did give the album five stardust that it takes a little getting used to for fans of the originals . that said , you will be pleasantly surprised at the transformation the songs undergo and the coolness that comes out the other side . you will be bobbing your head along in no time . note that for newcomers to me first and the give me gimmes , i also recommend their blow in the wind album , which brings a punk flavor to some of your favorite oldies . you can not go wrong with that !",182,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000IPAQ,"some guy said that me first included billie joe from green day ? wrong ! the gimmie jimmies are comprised of members of lagwagon , swingin utters , and no use for a name . this is the second time the guys have collaborated for a full length album , and in my opinion , this is the better of the two . it is awesome to be able to sing along with music the first time you hear it . i listened to this non stop for weeks when i bought it . everyone i know likes it . this is one of my favorite punk albums . ranks with home growns act your age , ten foot poles unleashed , even with bad religions stranger than fiction . love music ? you will love this album !",120,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"this excellent ad documents one of the greatest singers , songwriters at their best coming off one of the most influential albums of all times what has going on . marvin was absent from the stage prior to this recorded document some two years . a performer that was particularly paranoid about performing live . what this ad illustrates is the amazing power this man had once he hit the stage . from the opening strains of the overture to the closing of what has goin on you know you are in for something of a life time . as in added bonus on this ad they added the previously unreleased flying high in the friendly sky i mercy mercy me the ecology , keep gettin it on , introduction to the orchestra which did not appear on the orginal album version or the orginal ad version . highline on this fabolous ad trouble man , distant lover inner city blues . you know what ? the whole ad is so wonderful you really can not pick a highline . if you did not have this in your collection i certainly highly recommend this it should be in your collection . this is the best document of a genius at work . his legacy will forever live on pick this up .",199,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"marvin gaye was always a favorite of mine for his phrasing , and interpretations and how he could escalate the integrity of the writers vision either for himself or other writers . live 1974 is one of the few live albums that i treasure because of the musicians jameson , ray parker , ed greene and the others who also played on the let us get it on sessions , the arranger gene page . these were the valuable components of the motown sound . of course , the addition of flying high is a sweet bonus and this version of distant lover is a classic in itself . i am usually a favorite of studio music but this is a refreshing metamorphosis that i enjoy from beginning to end , first cut to last . needless to say , a lot of the artists and musicians gaye and jameson in particular left us too soon so we must enjoy what they left us and be thankful that god blessed us with their enormous talent .",162,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"it is really a lost art . gone are the days when top flight soul singers toured with a full orchestra . the 70s concerts on the rob scene benefited from the jazz era in this case , the big band era performers . believe me , you never hear anything like the margins backup band today . marvin gaye was never completely comfortable on stage . his vocals here rarely rises to the full zenith witness on vinyl . but then again by the time of let us get it on , gaye had adopted a laid - back approach which latter on influenced frankie beverly to his music and it is very evident on this live recording . highlights on the album are trouble man , distant lover and 60s medley suite . the two big hits are nothing special and pale considerably to the studio versions . for the most part the audio quality is fine , if not a little too sweet . but even this new remastered ad contains the same annoying mic feedback found on the orignal up .",164,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"one of my favorite of words albums because he has singing his heart even more than usual . nothing commercial going on here ; no pop tunes , no overt attempts at a single . instead , the best collection of lyrics gord ever put on a single album . each song evokes a particular mood ; just the right memories matched lyrically to just the right music . more than any other go album , this one makes me feel like i know him .",75,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,old dans records another classic album from gordon lightfoot ! if you love gordons music from the early 70s you will love this album . the music is still acoustic and this album is an interim album on his way to the massive album sundown . this album was a bit more of a sleeper in his catalog . no big hits on this one just old dans records ! it is definitely not my favorite album by him but it is classic lightfoot recorded during his peak ! a solid album by a legendary artist . the mastering and sound quality if very good and packaged is no frills but nice . great music at a great price,111,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"while there are other gordon lightfoot albums oops , i am showing my age that i like better , i find this album enjoyable too . his voice is good , and the musicianship is equally good . there is some soft banjo in the background , which most of his albums do not have . the words to the songs are included . even if they were not included , i can always understand every word he sings on his other albums . i just love his voice during this time period . i really like farewell to annabel , old dans records which i first heard on his great words gold , mother of a miners child , and my favorite tune you are what i am . the latter is such an upbeat love song . i am glad i added this to my gordon lightfoot collection .",132,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"old dans records was gordon lightfoot eighth album and the first of two released in 72 . the only other year this happened was in 68 . i think gordon may have been looking ahead to his follow - up album later in the year don quixote because old dans records is a little lacking when you consider that this was written and recorded during the prime of gordons career . containing -10 tracks , there is nothing that really stands out on this album or ad that would be considered classic lightfoot , or be included on a best of collection . it is enjoyable , but it will not get as much playing time when compared to many of his other albums or cos .",111,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"this is a very good album . it is just difficult to pick up a vibe from it in my opinion . it is hypnotic and i find myself listening to it time and again . although i can not get the idea out of my head that it is an album made up of afterthoughts . some think it is more upbeat , i say it has more of a somber feel to it . the standouts for me are farewell to annabel , that same old obsession and it is worth believing . it has it is high points , but again , to me it is difficult to nail down a vibe .",97,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"it has probably been 25 years since i listened to this album . i could not believe how good it sounded . i listened to it about 3 times in a row before i put it aside . words voice is at the peak of it is richness here . several songs it is worth believing , farewell to annabel are absolutely haunting , they are so moving .",59,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,lightfoot favorite that was good to hear again ! he is at his prime on this album both as a singer and songwriter .,22,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"this is gordon lightfoot and folk music at it is best . if i could only have one of bigfoots albums , this would be it .",23,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"gordon lightfoot is hard to come by here in sweden , so when i saw old dans dreamstreet rose in a used ad - shop i jumped at it . the rose is not nearly as good as old dans . this does not mean that od is outstanding in any way ! sure , there are a few gems on here , but so are there on all words cos . he has only himself to blame . if he persists in spoiling us , his audience , with great music , he will get no slack when he has on the download . all of words pre-80s catalogue is more or less flawless . this record is one of the less interesting from this period , but still it is a darn good waste of time !",121,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"canadian singer or songwriter or acoustic guitarist gordon lightfoot was in the midst of his creative zenith when old dans records was recorded in 1972 . so this album simply rolls from one melodic , emotional highlight to another . for me , so many of these songs echo places and times . the piano driven ballad same old obsession is like a melancholy victorian - era drama . lazy mornin suggests a idyllic day in the country . and despite it is title , can not depend on love has a wonderful lightness to it . what has interesting about this album is the history of it is time . in his book lightfoot : if you could read his mind , author maynard collins says lightfoot was going through marital difficulties in 1972 yes , they would lead to a divorce and he was recovering from a serious bout of something called bells palsy . this affliction affects facial muscles , and collins suggests pictures from that time including the album cover were done in such a way to hide the affected part of his face . all this makes the brilliance of old dans records even more astonishing .",171,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000050ZM2,"after seeing la vie en rose , i checked the various edith pia cos available and decided on this one . i absolutely love it and have actually purchased two more as gifts . next i got the ad of live concerts at the olympia . pia's voice is just unbelievable , filled with such emotion . i will never tire of listening .",57,0

Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,i have enjoyed this series very much . mother shun - company keeps a close eye and hand on her brood while uncle homage tries to keep the small world from being noticed by the outside worlds . great book and will continue to keep up on the small world family .,46,6
Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,i have thoroughly enjoyed both books in the series so far ! i truly did not expect the story to be so far reaching when i began the first book but i really enjoyed following the family reborn - in - jesus through a large portion of their entertaining and interesting lives . enough good science and enough comedy to keep both books moving fast . i would say almost a little too much action and simultaneous plot lines in littlest to really do justice to the vast universe the author has created here . but each section is hilarious and or or really interesting . i do not think i have laughed so hard at the thought of all of mankind on the brink of extinction since douglas adams which says a whole lot for my green i accomplishments as an author . please keep up the good work !,136,7
Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,"if you like a really strange , weird , and confusing story , then this is one you will like . after reading this story , i am not sure what it was about and maybe it is just me but i just could not follow the story line that well . maybe there is a book before this one that would make this one fall into place . without it this one makes no sense .",66,8
Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,"i really liked this sequel to smallworld . fun to read , but a little hard to follow sometimes , a little short on embroidering or it is maybe just me reading to hastily",30,9

Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,"i bought this after reading the first volume and while finding it readable , i can not rate it as highly as i had hoped . the author sees this work as cosmic satire , working in christian theology , greek gods , artificial intelligence , and military conflict . there is an interesting core having to do with the conflict between species preservation and species evolution . the depiction of a family of christian fundamentalist space pioneers is well done and filled with little ironies . the downside is a confusing story . the confusion lies in creating a world without rules . the author has created a world where every man - made object can think and act , where time can be manipulated , where telepathic control of others is possible , and where new technologies plop into the story from nowhere . i prefer a story where the author has imagined a different world which operates by different rules which nonetheless form a dysfunctional system that makes it is own sense . satire should not be a license for confusion . that said , the author is a brilliant writer with flashes of profound insight expressed in an interesting way .",182,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"a couple of years ago i had not even heard of this opera . now i keep humming the infectious tunes . natalie essay gives one of the great comic performances ever seen on stage or even film . she also sings beautifully . juan diego must be one of the great tenors , especially for this period in opera . i was reading on youtube today that he was not as good as pavarotti's or krauts . this is tosh ! juan diego sings this part effortlessly . buy this and play it to your friends , even although they may profess not to like opera .",97,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,i just saw the metropolitan he live simulcast of la fille du regiment yesterday and simply can not get over nathalie essays performance . her physical comedy is fabulous and what is truly astounding is how well she sings while being so physically active non - stop on stage . she was a joy to watch . flores was also wonderful .,55,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"i remember seeing a traditional la fille a long time ago ; i was bored stiff . but on the strength of the many 5 star reviews , i took a risk on this la fille . do it ! like the le elixir amore with netrebko and villain i donizettilelisir amore / eschew , netrebko , villain , wiener staatsoper , it takes middling music and makes it tremendous fun . do not let the anachronistic setting we i ? scare you off ; this is one of those cases where it works . essay starts out as a near - manic , but her acting quickly turns the prosaic story into a dramatic hoot . and then there has flores high is : enough said . i have not seen the competing la fille with ifi and flores , but this one is simply too much fun . get it .",131,2

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"the first time i saw this production , my memory says it was about 15 years ago , at the met and , at that time , natalie essay looked substantially younger . in fact , when i saw her , my first thought was that there had been a last - minute , unannounced change in the person playing the part of marie . as she walked on stage , she looked and moved so much like the country western singer , reba mcintyre , that i thought it was her , while i wondered what mcintyre was doing in a opera . needless to say , i was wrong , then . this is an excellently portrayed version of this opera , keeping the story , costuming and era in proper perspective . some of the costumes are a bit silly but , since this is a comic opera , it all fits . the quality of the singing is excellent , as well as the acting , making this another i would recommend .",149,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"for singers , especially , this is a spectacular and exciting event . seen on the giant cinema screen it was excellent , but scrutiny at ones leisure of the quality and talent of these two artists was breathtaking . actually , it was not just these two artists . the orchestra was spectacular with not a weak spot in the entire opera , crisp , clean execution , and magnificent musicality . the support singers were also better than you can imagine . i was unfamiliar with this opera until i saw this production , and can not for the life of me imagine anything more thrilling ! staging and comedy were not forced , but naturally good humored and beautifully timed . i bought this and have watched it several times . it is one of the most inspiring performances i have ever scene . you will love it !",129,9

Kindle_Store,B00EBLDASS,"from the amazon description , i was expecting something along the lines of starship andromeda , at least in premise . if i had not spent the first half of the book waiting for it to take off in a direction it was never heading , i probably would have enjoyed it more . i would not call this book a sci - fi adventure . it is more of an existential meander built on a sci - fi chassis . it is strange and weird and does not develop in the directions you expect it to . if you sit down to read it expecting some philosophical explorations and hypothetical moral questions instead of a space opera , you will probably enjoy it .",105,0
Kindle_Store,B00EBLDASS,"i rate this book as a decent read only in that while interesting , the book seems the conclusion of the book left something to be desired . the ending leaves one to wonder if the reader missed something . as an avid science fiction reader i would still recommend this book to others interested in science fiction .",55,1

Kindle_Store,B00EBLDASS,this book has a very lyrical quality in places . the science however stinks whereas the fiction part has it is bright moments . this book might be great to some while leaving others to scratch there heads in confusion . the author must have received a bit of criticism since he goes out of his why to explain segments of the story via addendum . this almost reminds me of 2001 space odyssey when arthur i clark wrote the book after the movie was released in order to explain what was going on . of course turbot is no arthur i clark especially when it comes down to the science of the story . in that respect the feel of the novel to me at least seemed metronome amounting the old fashioned x-1 stories of the 50s .,131,9

Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,this was a quick and fun read that definitely pulled me in right from the beginning . although it was a little bit more on the imaginative side and could use a little bit more editing it was fanciful and fun . i would like to read the other two books to see how it ends .,54,0
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,"this book was so amazing and even although i wish it was the whole book and not just part 1 of 3 , i am looking forward to reading the rest .",30,1
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,"i gave it 3 stars because i loved the character toke . the tenderness he showed and the way he took care of the female character was beautiful . there shoul be more sensitive characters like toke . the plot , especially the ending was really lame not very interesting .",47,2
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,"this book seemed alright for maybe the first chapter , then the spelling and grammar errors made it irritating . the main character was a typical mary - jane and lacked any sort of depth . she was confusing and knew things without being told . the dark elf barely spoke and did not seem to want to give much away but our main character still decided she was in love with him . only two thing are redeeming about this book ; first , it was free , and second it was short .",83,3
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,book it okay . needs a bettor editor because there were a ton of spelling errors .,15,4
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,i could not follow . it just was not good . i thought there would be a better story than what was there . sorry,20,5
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,stumbled on it when looking for something to fill time and what a cute story . i loved it . an adorable romance .,21,6
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,it is an excellent read i got hooked in on the first paragraph . i can not wait to read the next book !,20,7
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,the only reason it is not a 5 is because it too short of a read .,15,8
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,some of the sentences did not make sense due to missing letters of some words or improper spelling . needs editing . was not a really great read .,25,9
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,good book would like the whole series to be free . love the characters in this book . keep up the good work .,21,10
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,a bit short on substance . i was disappointed when it finished . unless the story continues in another book of course in which case i can not wait to read the next one .,30,11
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,this book is very thrilling to read loved it a lot and have the other two as well thanks for a good read,23,12
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,"ok so i had an issue with this book first off we know nothing about marla , yet it seems like we are expected to very early on . also i just would like to know how she knows he has a dark elf or what the beast thing looked like it is an interesting story that needs more details to be good .",59,13
Kindle_Store,B00C16YL10,you need an open mind to understand where this book is based . fascinating read but short . just enough to whet the appetite for the next book in the series . i am searching for that book now .,36,14
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,"this is a great way to fill the time that aryl spent his time , while presumably dead . it makes you feel sorry for gina and mickey , because they have a great price to pay . i wonder how that will work out . this book is much better than book two , which i could not finish . i hope book four is just as good as three . thank you",65,0
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,this is one you can not wait to see how it ends but you do not look ahead because you can not imagine any ending and you need to know how what leads to an ending .,33,1
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,this book was hard to get into but once i sorted all the characters out i enjoyed it more . i love a good detective story .,25,2
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,the story just drifted from one scene to another . hard to keep up with who was doing what i,19,3
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,"the 1929 series have been slow starters , but they are very interesting and great reads once into them . this book i found a bit slower and not quite as interesting . still enjoyed it .",33,4
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,what a story well written and it had me begging for more . recommend to all mystery buffs . keep me hanging and asking for more .,24,5
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,it is a must read . this fills in the blanks about what happens between book 2 elizabeth heart and book 3 1930 aryl divide .,24,6
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,enjoyed the continued story of the three friends . complex side story of the mental hospital system during the great depression . waiting for the next installment .,25,7
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,each of this authors books have been great . this one is too . i love the ending as it fills my need of facts,23,8
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,i read the book leading up to this one for free and liked it enough to buy this one . this time the author disappointed me . the book jumps around between the two main characters into the past and back to the present withouth any clarity of who i am reading about . it takes several sentences if not a whole paragraph to figure that out . on top of that none of the characters drew me in . frankly i did not care what happened to any of them .,84,9
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,"the beginning was a bit slow to catch my complete interest , but soon became a page turner for me . the characters were nicely formed and likeable for the most part .",30,10
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,i have enjoyed each of the seriessome amountook forward to reading the next one !,13,11
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,"again , an ok book . it is tells us what happened to aryl while he was missing . it is a story that also combines richard sloan , a detective for missing persons . richard is telling us his story and aryl is also recounting his . neither seem to be telling in chronological order , so it gets a bit confusing . like elizabeth heart , a lot of it seems irrelevant . that being said , i stuck with it , because aryl was part of the original group , and i did care about those characters and what happened to them . i will probably buy the next one , when it comes out , because i hate leaving loose ends , but i hope it stays a bit more on events as they are unfolding and the characters reactions to it , rather than off into things on central or lala land stuff .",139,12
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,an interesting study of human nature and of the problems of the time . you want to read all the books .,20,13
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,intertwining stories loners and a cast of characters that make putting thus novel aside for later will be hard to do . well paced and leave you want to read more of detective sloans adventures .,34,14

Kindle_Store,B00H0LAI3Q,"do not be deceived by the simplicity of these mini - missions , their power is huge . if you are familiar with courtney carvers website , be more with less , then you might already be familiar with her mini - missions . they usually take only a few minutes , and have the power to dramatically change or improve something in your life , especially those little niggles you seem to be unable to shake ! in this collection , courtney pulls together some trailblazers in modern minimalism or simplicity , covering a wide range of topics . i would have thought it is pretty much impossible to read this and not write down at least a handful of mini - missions you want to get started on straight away . highly recommended !",109,1

Kindle_Store,B007IPTXQ2,"i was watching acts first tuesday book club the other day and judy nun was sharing her thoughts about several books . i was so impressed with her observations that i thought she must be a good writer because she understood a books big picture , so i decided to seek out some of her work . i came across the wardrobe at a very reasonable price . instead of adding it to my very long wish list i bought it immediately , started reading and did not want to put it down . loved it . i am looking forward to reading more of her work .",98,1
Kindle_Store,B007IPTXQ2,this was an easy read but i did not find it all that interesting and it was a bit short . i had previously read di morrissey the golden land and the main idea was similar in both books . i enjoyed the latter book more .,43,2

Kindle_Store,B007IPTXQ2,"this was a nice little story , it was not riveting or hard to put down but it was okay .",18,8
Kindle_Store,B007IPTXQ2,"this short little story says so much . how often do we dismiss the elderly , we forget that they have lived a full life of sometimes joy and often sorrow . sometimes of great adventure and or sacrifice . if we only took the time to sit down and talk to them , what treasures could be unearthed as in this book .",58,9
Kindle_Store,B007IPTXQ2,"how interesting ? have you every wondered who live in your house before you ? how exciting to unravel previous lives of such people , very entertaining and loved it as usual judy makes me laugh and cry . wonderful australian writer .",38,10

Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"i really wanted to love this book . i am a huge fan of the author , but this one just fell short for me . the synopsis pulled me in , but the actual story moved so fast i could not keep up . i felt like i needed to have more of a relationship established between lindy and lucas before the big mess up that tears them apart . because the mess up is huge ! i did not really feel they had a strong friendship to start with , so when the thing happens i hated lucas so much i was not able to really relate to the characters afterwards . i had a hard time believing lucas after lindy came back in to his life . he does some really crappy things and i just could not find a way to really like him again . i really liked the storyline and i think for me if i could have gotten a better sense of them before i could have gotten in to it more , but without the background i really found myself not loving this one . i love emily minton and this will not keep me from reading the next book . i look forward to reading about tara and daniel .",200,0
Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,emily did it again it does not matter what she is writing about all of her books are fantastic i loves this book . i love how she wrote a little memory at the begin of the chapters and had the book in both character point of view . i can not wait to read more of this series,57,1
Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"a best friends to lovers crossed with a second chances story , i enjoyed some of this story , thought the sex scenes were pretty good but ultimately found too much of it too predictable to rate higher than three stars .",39,2
Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"i was amazed at this book . it was well written and a roller coaster of emotion and suspense . i found this to be a sweet book of friendship , betrayal , forgiveness . melinda lindy lou is sweet , smart , overweight and not popular at all . she has bullied at school called piglet and lucas does not even stick up for her . she came across really nave and too forgiving of lucas all the time . she accepted his friendship anyway he provided it to her because she was secretly in love with him . but then one night changes everything . i loved the story line between lucas and melinda but i hated lucas at the beginning of this book . it took alot for me to change my opinion of him . but thank god he turned into a nice guy after everything . i love emily books and can not wait to read more of them .",146,3

Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"lucas is such a caveman , and he has so lewd . but i absolutely loved lindy , she overcame so much . you just want her to be happy",25,8
Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"there are moments of sweetness sprinkled in this friends - to - lovers romance and then there are chunks of complete douchey . i feel like this is a story that i should have read when i was 16 as a manual of what kind of guy to steer clear from because he is dysfunction wrapped up in the prettiest package . the relationship was really annoying to me and the way lucas and lindy came back together was more than badly clich , but that had nothing to do with the writing skills of ms. minton . she painted a fair and accurate picture of all that was irritatingly realistic in these characters .",106,9
Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,loved it ! finished in a day . could not put it down . fast paced but with good detail . has some great steamy sex scenes for those who like that . cute love story !,30,10

Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,this was terrible . the storyline itself was creative but the story was underdeveloped . it is like the author just got lazy . i am so confused as to why this got such high reviews . it was really not good . the characters were not even likeable .,43,12
Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,i have been waiting for this book since reading the prologue a few weeks ago . definitely worth the wait and enjoyed the story and all the characters even the hateful ones ! admired the transformation of both i i and hope to see more of them in future stories . i look forward to more books written by ms. minton both individually and her collaborative efforts .,64,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"the first song i heard by bel was jane , on an alternative radio station in la . it really stood out amongst all the other songs being played , because it is lyrics were smart and funny , and the music was great . when i found out they were canadian , that sealed it i i had to get the album . i am canadian and i favor canadian artists . i listened to it over and over and find it hard to say which tracks are the best . they are all so good ! i shared it with a friend who said their musicianship was outstanding . me , i just love the catchy songs , that sound so different than anything else being played . it is refreshing ! i recommend this album to anybody who likes to hear something different , that is quality . most musicians probably do not like comparisons , but to give an idea about these guys , i would say the combination of excellent musicianship and witty lyrics could compare them to steely dan on a happier , more fun level . i have since bought 2 more bel albums but this one still stands out as the best , with stunt a close second . carry on guys , you are great ! you have a long and prosperous future .",201,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"even although the group has put out several other cos , all of which i have , this is by far the best one ! the ad has that great mixture of humor , witticism , and ballads that you can not possibly go wrong with ! if you are going to buy any ad from fulsome amounted them all , but if you are looking for one that includes every possible emotion and the wittiest lyrics , buy maybe you should drive !",72,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"ok if you are on the hunt for a good bare naked ladies ad this album will satisfy your needs . not that the other albums are not good because they are completely awesome , but this ad is probably the one to set your tastebuds to bel music . if your not happy with this album , your probably not going to like the band . that is all there is to it ! with a wide variety of heartfelt lyrics you will be waiting jane to funny tunes that keep you smiling a life in a nutshell the ad is very well rounded . i purchased it from one of those funky mail - in ad clubs hoping it would contain the smash hit if i had some amount of money i had heard the song on the radio , found out about the band and fell completely in love , but . to my dismay the song did not appear on the track list . i popped the album in my stereo anyway and have been a devoted bel fan ever since . i bought the remainder of bel cos and discovered my favorite band of all time . maybe you should drive is a definite must for anyone even slightly interested in the sweetly addicting bare naked ladies .",201,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"two of the songs on this album everything old is new again and the wrong man was convicted got me through a particularly difficult breakup with my girlfriend at the time . needless to say , this album has a special place in my collection . it is a good listen all - around , and if you are in a difficult emotional state like i was , it may strike a chord with you as well . bel has always been one of my favorite bands , and this album is a prime example of the way that bel pours their collective heart and soul into their work .",98,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"coming after their classic debut gordon , this was quite a switch for steve , ed and the rest of the boys . where as gordon was mostly full of funny , quirky songs . maybe you should drive is a much more personal album , that shows that bel is about a lot more then just being goofy . it shows that they can write some truly beautiful songs . this ad is not only my favorite bel album , but my favorite album period . it still has their trademark sense of humor through - out , but it definitely shows a different side to these guys . and further proves that barenaked ladies are without a doubt the best band out there today !",111,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"all of the songs are classic . life , in a nutshell is my favorite song by them . these apples is amazing . if you do not own this , you are missing out on a lot .",31,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"this gets four stars only because the wackiness that epitomized gordon is totally gone in this follow - up album . possibly because they changed producers from wojewoda to mink the sound is the same , but the subject matter is quite a bit different . also new are a couple songs that i could do without . these apples and a are not miho the strongest tracks , but i would not skip them consistently . particular favorites are jane , everything old is new again , and life , in a nutshell . this album seems more moody than gordon , probably because while the cleverness in the songwriting is still there , the whimsical subject matter is absent .",106,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"to this ad that is . maybe you should drive and stunt are my favorite bel recordings . they are more mature than gordon , but still pleasingly playful . bel are a refreshing experience compared to so much loud , heavy , hateful rap - metal - punk bands these days . these canadians continue to prove their musical and lyrical talents . this is a good buy . 4 stars .",59,14

Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,too bad that gordon felt he had to write a third tome which is far below the first and way below the second volume of the trilogy .,27,1
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,hard to read . but good once you get into it . very interesting !,13,2
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"for a clear presentation of the path medicine has taken over the centuries , this series can not be beat . who knew that medicine as we know it was considered unchristian in the 15th century or that cutting into the body of a dead person was against the laws of islam ? the three books cover the practice of medicine during three periods of history , medieval days of the barber surgeon , the 1860s in the midwest and modern times in a small town .",80,3
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"the first book of this trilogy is a well written account of a young mans journey , to follow his dream of becoming a physician , through childhood to seniority . set in the 11th century it would also fit into modern day accounting , and the author carries you along with sights and sounds , to put you in the very places in which the main character finds himself . looking forward to reading the other , non - related , stories in this one book",76,4
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"really enjoyed the first two stories of the trilogy , could hardly put the book down . the final chapter of the trilogy whilst enjoyable was not quite as spell binding as the first two although .",34,5

Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"enthralling story of three different members of the cole family who carried on the tradition of becoming physicians over a millennia , showing the progress of medicine against . quack treatments over an extensive period . character development and historical details make the reader feel as although they were living through these periods with all the challenges and dangers of those times . highly recommended !",61,7
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"the physician was outstanding . every page was an adventure , and i hated for it to end . shaman started off good , but bogged down in the middle , reading more like a textbook , but ended ok . matters of choice ? yuck ! read like a soap opera . could not wait for it to end . i could not believe it was written by the same author .",59,8
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,shaman was also very historical accurate and gave a good history of matters during the civil war . was disappointed in matters of choice . did not have the same historical relevance or excitement of the other two books .was a love story that meandered on and on . i would give this book two stars at most .,55,9
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"the first book of the trilogy was interesting , took place in the 11th century with wonderful descriptions of the special gift the main character had as well as descriptions of life , cultural differences and education in the area we now call the middle east . the 2nd book took place during the expansion of america toward the west ; the characters were fairly well defined and the premise of the special gift was explored along with interaction among the native american and different ethnic values . the story ended with the civil war . it was a good book but not special . the 3rd book took place in more contemporary times . i felt it was a little too much like a coming of age soap opera it was entertaining like a summer beach novel . i can not give it more than 3 stars due to the lack of character development and conceptual premise behind the 2nd and 3rd books .",154,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"my two personal favorites are fuego de noche , niece de dia and a medio vivir . the quality of his voice is wonderful . and of course , his version of maria as well as bomb de acar are very uplifting . my personal choice of ad to light the incense and just unwind .",49,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"i consider a medio vivir to be one of ricky martins two best cos the other one being the superb vuelve . this ad of latin pop contains many well - crafted songs , all performed with skill and enthusiasm by the versatile martin . he can play it smooth or belt it out like a true male diva whatever the song calls for . all of the lyrics are in spanish . as a whole , the songs on a medio vivir are a diverse bunch . corazon has a disco feel , and revolution has an edgier rock sound . bomb de acar has delightfully playful rhythms and lyrics . maria is the most obviously latin of the songs , with it is strongly percussive instrumentation and overall tropical flavor . ricky performances are especially strong on the emotional ballads : solvers , te extra , and fuego de noche . a medio vivir is an essential disc for fans of latin pop . and those who are only familiar with ricky english - language work should definitely check out this disc . his energy transcends language barriers .",166,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"this is a pretty good ad . after being a fan of vuelve , and the new ad i had to buy this one . the original of maria is on here , it is really good , also fuego de noche , a medio vivir , maria , bomb de acar . these are very good songs .",49,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"ricky best album is arguably still his 1999 us ricky martin with it is hit livin la vida loca , but this one is still my favorite . ricks rich voice soars on tracks such as te extra , te lido , te amo and leaves us wanting more with every note . a fine actor as well as a singer , ricky sang this song on general hospital and had me gasping . gloria estefan helped bring latino pop into the mainstream , but i believe that it is ricky who will take it to it is highest success . highly recommend this album for any latin music fan , ricky martin fan , or anyone who wants to listen to true romance . also check out his 1991 ricky martin album",118,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"this ad is one of his best . it has great songs on it like solvers , the original version of maria and bon bon de acar . this ad is ricky at his romantic best , if you are looking for a ad for a romantic evening at home , this ad delivers ! even if you do not understand spanish , ricky voice carries the emotions across the language barrier . just beautiful ! i highly recommend it !",71,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"not as consistently excellent as the long black veil , but buy this album for three great songs : the lowlands of holland natalie merchant uses her beautiful voice with great subtlety , i know my love the corps version is irresistible ; the lead vocal is reminiscent of debbie harry on some of blondies most upbeat songs , and raglan road joan osborne voice can break your heart , and it is just as devastating here as on the best songs from relish . a ad with three great songs is better than one with twelve good ones ! the rest of the album is fun to listen to , but not memorable .",104,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"what a waste of money ! the whole ad is a disappointment . the songs all lack emotion , and the singers do not perform at their best . this is certainly one to pass up .",32,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"such deep emotion , such a unique blending of styles . such innovation from a talented band of old guys . my only complaint is that they do not put out more albums .",29,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"it is easy to get overloaded on the chieftains i they have recorded so much that i sometimes start to think of them as part of the grand museum of irish culture , but then i listen , and it is always fresh . this is a very polished band that has the gift of sounding spontaneous see beausoleil for a cajun equivalent . here are a bunch of sad songs sung by women singers who have made reputations in rock or folk or country , not necessarily irish sinead connor being an exception . it is very well done on the whole , with the lower womens voices doing particularly well . bonnie raita and joan osborne do tremendous jobs , the latter with a raglan road that would be too slow if it was not so good . joni mitchell is powerful in the magdalene laundries , and bissel and sinead also do well . sounding a bit fragile vocally , but still effective , are natalie merchant and lorena mckenzie . one disappointment is diana calls danny boy . it is too breathy and there are semi - garland effects that i do not care for . it is a great melody i just let it flow !",183,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,this is a very poor effort . does not rate a second listening .,12,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"i love the chieftains and was really looking forward to hearing this ad . while it is good , i was a bit disappointed with it too . the songs individually are fine , but the general tone of the album is too slow and somber . i feel it needs more variety . as i listen to it from start to finish , i find myself getting a bit depressed by it . some highlights are saki in the jar , the madeline laundries and the long instrumental set the fiddling ladies . remember although that i am judging this against the standards of other chieftains albums which is a very high standard indeed . if you are seeking an introduction to their music , i would suggest the long black veil . or an irish evening",122,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"i will start off by saying that i dig the fact that these guys after performing for 40 - odd years together are still looking for new ways to express themselves . they refuse to be a cliche or to stagnate . i just saw them here in reno this past weekend and while it felt a little sad to not have derek bell and martin fay up there , they still played with great energy and passion . those guys never mail it in . having said that , this one was not my favorite . i felt many of the tunes were a little slow and one - note . i just could not get passionate about their efforts here . it felt a little flat . the real spunk came from the corps who play a lively and fresh version of i know my love and sake in the jar had real wit . never give all the heart a song and word rendition of the yeats poem was haunting . so i guess you could say some of the parts were truly brilliant it is the chieftains after all ! but the whole just never quite clicked for me .",181,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,how can one not like a chieftains album .,8,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"words can not describe how terrible this album is . i bought it for a version of raglan road , and there is one good song of about 10 minutes that is a great classic fiddle and guitar jam , but the rest is down right depressing and awful music . some of the lyrics talk of fathers raping their daughters . not your traditional irish and chieftains music to say the least . stay away .",69,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"this effort by the chieftains is joyless . it is aptly named for it will surely depress you . we listened to it once and never took it out again . in fact , this is a good reminder to myself to throw it out .",41,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"i bought this for the diana krill cover of danny boy and that cut alone has proven to be worth twice the price . i hard to get through the song without moist eyes . but i was very pleasantly surprised and rewarded by most of the other pieces . although i have never been a huge joni mitchell fan , her magdalene laundries is quite nice . factory girl by sinead conner is mesmerizing . but joan osborne was really the surprise for me . i had seen her on to a few times and never took much notice but her angelic voice on raglan road blew me away . on the strength of that , i ordered relish and righteous love and have not been disappointed . i warning : osborne will sound like many different women ! it is uncanny !",128,13

Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,i received this book for an honest review . raleigh and mia are sisters they have lost everyone around them and raleigh is so desperately looking for a job so they can survive when an earthquake hits . raleigh and mia become separated through this and raleigh knows she has to find her . jackson is sent from camera to capture raleigh and bring her there but when her sees her he knows there is something different so he has to decide if he is going to follow orders or not . you are taken through a portal back and forth in this book from earth to camera . you have to pay attention in some parts to know what is going on . it will not be what you expected . there is however a lot of action .,132,7
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"stop reading these reviews and start reading this book . the wonderful characters , unique storyline and descriptive voice make this a must - read . i am excited for this series and can not wait to dive into book two hopefully soon . i was given this book in exchange for an honest review via netgalley .",50,8
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"i received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review . this is a great book , and is good for teens and up . i really enjoyed reading this book , the situation of children without guardians hit close to home as i just took in foster children . the girls really take care of reach other and are surrounded by the ghosts of their past but when they meet jackson he shows them there is more to home than a building . raleigh is a natural leader and i liked reading her and jacksons start . i really can not wait to hear more of the story unfold . bowie",104,9
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,but i did not enjoy this book . halfway through i wanted to stop reading but my need to finish any book i start made me power through it . what did not i like ? the now - standard insta - love . flat characters . the confusing writing . there were several times that i had to re - read a passage several times to figure out what it said . the number of times the word cocky was used . the very obviously bad bad - guy . i kept wondering how thick the main characters could be to not see what was made so obvious .,91,10
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"i read this book a while ago and absolutely loved it ! i could not put it down . such a great fantasy world and characters . i was on the edge of my seat the whole time . counting down the days until october 13th , when the second book comes out !",48,11
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,really enjoyed this novel . original fresh concept and characters . would recommend to anyone who is looking for an engaging unique story .,21,12
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"for some reason it took me longer to read this book . i think part of it was because i was ok stopping which is rare . this book was very fast - paced . the storyline kept moving and moving . i liked it although because it was different than a lot of other books that i liked . i really liked how raleigh was spelt . also there was not a lot of freaking out on her end about the situation . i hate the required 10 - page freak out about the situation . i really appreciated the relationship that she has with her sister . i really wanted more from the relationship between jackson and raleigh . there were very few moments between them and i think it would be important to see more of their relationship . there was some world - building in this book , but nothing too confusing . i think it would have been helpful to talk more about what makes jackson different or the people in this other realm special . this book was all about not wasting time which i liked . i hate time - wasting in this book . there will be a sequel so i am so excited for it ! note : i received a free copy of this book in return for an honest review !",204,13
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,the writing here needs some refinement but the story is well thought out and enjoyable . characters were likeable and believable .,20,14
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"i am learning to love this authors writing . i liked the world that the author built . i liked the love story between the mes . i liked that the feelings for each other was built up slowly . the only thing i did not care for was the many different characters the author introduced in the book . this can get confusing for me . i have to say that it was well do although . i hope there is a sequel to this world , i would love to return to it .",86,0
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"the characters were so well developed and realistic . this is not a story of insta - love . kudos has a deep shame of his attraction to veil ; who happens to be a 20yro male prostitute . the development of their relationship was gradual and realistic . the supporting characters were great additions to the story . the sex scenes are well written and well placed in the story . i do not want to give any spoilers away . so i will simply say that the themes of the story cover topics such as homosexuality in religious beliefs and religious culture to the consequences of shaming and prejudices . the author clearly gets her opinions across without being disrespectful to those who have different opinions . this book deserves a 5 stars rating . bow , rape is alluded to and implied at certain times in the story . however , the author does not go into explicit details describing rape .",147,1

Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,it was okay . the amount of typos bothered me . think the story could have been crafted better than what it was .,21,6
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"it is hard to review this book . it was good , the story original and peopled with very interesting characters , however it felt much too long . possibly because at about the half - way mark the author started introducing new characters and it almost felt like a deviation from the original story arc . it was a good story but the pacing could use work as if the first half needed to be more concise or it needed to be more than one book .",80,7
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"the book started out well , but then i started to lose interest with all the angst and suffering and traumas . when the castle section began , i really began skimming through it . i did notice misplaced and missing commas , bothers instead of brothers although the brothers were a bother and the the instead of to the so if little errors like this bother you , be warned that they do exist in this book . it was not bad , it just was not that good . the sex scenes were okay , but nothing specialneither added to nor retracted from the story .",97,8
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,although the character of kids was not a loveable one at first and veil was in his way a spoiled bratty fell in love and made each other bettering is not that what we are all looking for ? our better half ?,44,9

Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,this is a long read and worth every moment ! lia blacks characters are always phenomenally complex and this story continues that trend while also providing a fantasy adventure that does not take a backseat to the romance . both are front and center leaving the reader completely satisfied as a true blend of genres should .,53,11
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"i really enjoyed and loved this wonderful book it was written so lovely . i love all of the books i have read so far from this author . i have read worthy and where willows will not grow these books are beautifully written also . i love the relationship between veil and kids and relationship between crow and barman . i love everything about this book it was very emotional i cried it was sad at times , i laugh at the comedy , i seat on the edge of the seat at the action , and could not wait to see what happen next with all the twists and turns . at the end of this book seemed like there could be another book i would not mind that as long as it was as good as this one . i hope if there is another book the same characters and then some in that book . i will recommend this book to everybody i know and to all my friends too .",162,12

Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,fast read loved it do not think i am reading faster just think book was written for pure enjoyment,17,2
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"i like stories with animals , especially dogs and the authors description of dandy is so clear that i always have a visual representation before me . the story was intriguing because the dandy used only his dog sense without any senses enhanced by trying to make him into a human , just plain common dog sense and that was endearing enough to me . dogs have such keen intelligence and this was demonstrated . it is a short story and just the thing to put a smile on your face before sleep comes .",88,3
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,this is the second short story by m. locke that i have read . as before i enjoyed it and plan to read more .,23,4
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,the dog sniffs out a mystery . i hope the author writes more stories in 19th century san francisco . she is a good storyteller and the host primal aspect seems so real .,31,5
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"the writing was ok , setting and time period cute , but i found it irritating that this and others were a fragment of story instead of a novel and were not clearly marked as short stories . will not buy any more from this author , on principle .",43,6
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,it was an interesting read but the author made it as a very short read . why ? the boston terriers personality fit in well with the authors work . no doubt the author must have pets . it would take the authors instinct and knowledge of pets to initiate this short read . thank you .,51,7
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,a wonderful short story set in the turn of the century san francisco . has wonderful characters and plot . these characters are also in her first book of a series set during that time . i am currently reading her book maids of misfortune in the series . i truly look forward to her next book .,52,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"not quite country , not quite pop but quite good . not sure why she has gotten so much hype compared to other artists that are her equal and remain unknown - good agent i guess . but it is a fine album .",36,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"i have recently heard gift merrit on gas and fell in love with her immediately . she is the epitome of what it means to be a singer or songwriter . her music and lyrics can be as diverse as her voice . i have read some reviews and from what i have seen , people try to compare her to everyone else . do not do that . listen to her music as if it is the first time you have ever heard a sound . judge her then , not after you have heard someone you think she should sound like . i urge you to pick up tambourine and her first album as well , bramble rose . each ad is completely and utterly different from the next and you will not be disappointed .",122,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"gift merritt second album tambourine was well worth the wait . i was impressed with her debut album , bramble rose . unfortunately , that album never really found an audience . this album is just as good , if not better . i find the sound on this album is more evolved , and overall just pleasant from start to finish . there has a lot more uptempo material here , but still brilliant lyrical moments that are poignant and touching . the album starts off strongly with the opening track",80,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"this is the first album of gift i have heard . i bought it because they played her song good hearted man in to and i immediately fell in love with that song . it sounds quite like the older pop song all i really need is just a soul man or however the title was . the album was a surprise . a wonderful voice , fast rhythmssome amounted melodies enjoyed it very much . i can only recommend it .",76,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"i first heard good hearted man on knot in new braunfels to and thought gift sounded a lot like emmylou harris which is a compliment to be sure , although the song did not impress me all that much . it was not until i heard write my ticket that i realized her depth as a songwriter . i am a sucker for a good redemption song , and ticket gets to me like delbert clintons cover of the otis redding classic dreams to remember , and that is about as good as it gets . i bought the ad and the rest is history . ms. merritt has talent , both as a performer and songwriter , and that is a rarity in this day and age . she has destined for bigger things than americana radio , and good for her .",126,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"maybe it is that i discovered gift by way of bramble rose , but i have to agree with moose of many waters review above ; she has a talented artist but this is not the album that is going to get her to stardom . it hearkens back too much to dusty springfield without ever giving us a reason to think she has found her own voice here . that is not to say this album does not have it is moments , but nothing here demands your attention the way trouble over me did on her previous album . if anything , too much money has been spent on this album ; she would be better served to go back to more intimate productions , perhaps a la willie nelsons red - headed stranger .",114,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"this second ad by gift surpasses even the best of other female singer or songwriters like carole king and shania twain , who deserving had albums that were a huge commercial success . tambourine is great from top to bottom and the last 5 songs are as good as it gets . to fully appreciate her superb songwriting , one needs to listen and read along with the lyrics a couple of times . her songs combine sensible lyrics with excellent melodies that cover the whole spectrum of tempo . it is hard to pin her down to one genre , but this album deserved more that just the grammy nomination that it got . i do not see how every review could not give it 5 stars !",117,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"let me start off by saying that i expected this album to be goodfor stars good . i am not a fan of country music , however , and that made me hesitant to try gifts music . after listening to samples on amazon i was contemplating buying it and then i heard stray paper on the radio and that tipped the scales towards buy ! i am glad i did , the ad is amazing and i am now looking to buy her debut , bramble rose . if you like this , i recommend gemma hayes and rachael yamagata as wealthy are similar , but not the same and each has unique talents that make their music really great .",112,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"very good set . ms. merritt grows on you like a mint julia or two . it takes listening to more than once to convince one how good she is . it is never fair to compare one singer to another . however , i get a dusty springfield vibe here . and that is simply great ! until the classic that i know is soon to come is released , this album ad will do quite well thank you .",72,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"gift rocks out on this album ! i immediately loved wait it out and late night pilgrim , but i have come to love the entire album . this is one of those albums that i have played front to back , repeatedly , for days and weeks on end . i caught her live at scuba chicagofabulous live show . her opening act , nora connor , was also excellentless rock and more country , but excellent all the way around .",75,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"good stuffblues - rock that is energetic , has horns what song is not better with horns ! ? ! , and translates well into gifts energetic live show . a few other reviewers have mentioned the couple of sheryl crow knock - off songs as being too poppy and knocking this album down a notch . that is fair criticism , but sheryl crow also wishes she could make an album that rocks like this !",66,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"again , gift merritt delivers some great sounds . the combination of her sweet voice coupled with the sounds of her strong band is what makes for some of the best music in country . it is her songs we should be hearing more often on the top 40 . but like so many other obscure talented song writers and singers , gift is left in obscurity on cut or gas and their award shows .",69,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"this woke me up . introductory song with just the guitar and the voice and the band kickin in after coupla bars . i stray paper . great . all songs written and song by the artist are good with one or two exceptions , mostly because of my personal taste . great backup band and lead and backup guitarists . bass and percussion , also . who is the piano player , no credit on the ad ? good album .",69,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,gift merritt has a great voice with a fresh style . one of the best cos i have purchased in a long time .,21,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"gift merritt tambourine is a remarkably strong set with no weak spots . her sound expands from the excellent bramble rose to include more of a soul punch . producer george drakoulias has worked with maria mckee ; and tambourine certainly has much of the appeal of the great lone justice lips . the opening track stray paper is addictive with mike campbells stinging lead guitar and merritt rocking vocal , somewhere there has a letter that i never sent . it used to read pretty , now it is empty as that night in the headlights with the blankets pressed . was it something to you baby , or was it just stray paper ? the second track wait it out also rocks with a vengeance , making this a great uptempo set . still pretending is a slow tune with a classic country or soul feel that encourages dusty in memphis comparisons . your love made a u - turn is another soul burner with a delightful horn section that urges me to hit the repeat button . maria mckee joins with background vocals on late night pilgrim . the ad ends on another high point with the driving toe tapper shadow in the way . tambourine shows gift merritt pulling together expressive vocalssome amounted songwriting and excellent musicianship for a blockbuster performance . wow !",204,14

Kindle_Store,B00AQ8HTFU,"i thoroughly enjoyed this short introduction to a new author to me and a new culture . the two short stories are really the same story , told from the points of view of the human and the toward perspective . even although it is the same story , different insights into the planets culture are gained from each . i found myself wanting to know lonesome amounts more ! the human appearing toward have been there where the humans are now . exploring space and meeting other races , but chose to abandon all that and now keep to their planet developing their inner abilities . they are also hiding all that , and more , from their human visitors . the character development was adequate for a short story but i want to learn more about the rural and the johann . can not wait to read the longer novels .",135,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001FQ7,i give this release 3.5 stars it is their debut album and debut releases are not always the best releases but you have to start some where . i listen to it but not as often as some of their late releases . i consider it a springboard for what was down the road .,51,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001FQ7,"love to , old school rock and roll from the good ole days , when rock really existed . this band was quite underrated in their day , often criticized for their diet , shape , form , or use of chords when in fact all they delivered was hard hitting guitar riffs , catchy chords and choruses and great vitals . this up is one of their less mainstream titles , but one of my favorites . randy bachman , pictured on the cover , was once one of the main forces behind the guess who and is inducted into the canadian rock and roll hall of fame , both as a solo artist as well as with to . superb recordsome amounting it a listen .",112,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"i purchased this album to give the new lead singer a listen . i am a hard core steve perry fan and although ariel pined resembles steve , he does not capture the soul that steve put into every single song . steve perry is truly the heart and soul of journey . try as they might . he will never be replaced .",57,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"why addictive ? . i have been listening only to this album and it is songs since i have gotten it and nothing else . i love the ballads and the rock out tunes on both ad while thumping my feet to the beats . and never got bored with it . the new songs are great while the re - recorded classic hits are just as good . the did footage is excellent and i probably viewed it more than ten times already in it is entirety . also i have anticipated the release of this album with much excitement especially when they acquired ariel pined . this guy is very talented and has a unique voice that delivers journeys songs in their legacy sound trademark . i know my place in appreciating good music and good musicianship of talented artist like journey and will not waste my thoughts on comparing the perry or pined debacle . i would say get over it folks if you are . bottoming is , i love journey during the perry days and i love them now just the same with much anticipation of great music to come down the road for their fans . this is a great albumsome amount get one .",183,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"i will tell you right up front adore steve perry and wish he would never left the band . he will never be replaced in our hearts . however , at some point we all have to let go of the past and move forward . i just got my copy of revelation and i love it . ariel pined can do justice to journeys old sound , but he has creating a new journey sound all his own . i have always felt that the other replacement singers were trying too hard to emulate steve perry . that is probably why we never could accept them . i suspect they were chosen just for their voices , not because they had any magic spark that made the whole group click . i think ariel has the magician like journey has risen from the dead . now i wish that steve perry would put out another albumthe world would be a better place if he would share his voice with us again .",159,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"my favorite part of the disc has ariel pines vocals on classic journey hits , which i think does a fantastic job of assuring everyone that pined has the skill and vocal charm to measure up to anyone who came before him . in fact , he has a stronger vocalist than perry and articulates better pines lyrics are clearer , easier to understand . i think it is cool to have one of the all - time great bands open to the idea of hiring a singer who are not from around here . revelation is a great album , and i am very happy i finally picked it up .",98,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"another very predictable white bread album from a band that lost it is soul when steve the band killer perry ruined a very great rock group . put the ad in , sit back a beat your head with a hammer for even thinkin about buying this album . the new singer will be gone after this hokum tour which will never touch the guitar strap of the greg rollie band . hey journey fans get off the pot .",74,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"the new singer is more of a performer then my rock star steve perry . this guy not only bring back the classic sound but room to grow ! if perry were in the band there would be no new albums and they would be on the oldies tour ! this is the best they have sounded in years ! ariel is not a rock star but singer who wants it bad not live in the past ie : steve perry , axel rose ! just listen to the ad it is better than a percentage of the new stuff ! it is 2008 not 1981 ! welcome back journey with open arms !",102,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"thank you neal schon for picking ariel pined to be the lead singer of journey . steve perry was like jose carrera , a tenor with more refine voice . however , ariel pined is like pavoratti , a power tenor . definitely journey made the right decision to go forward with ariel , who will bring back old fans and create new fans . and thank you to youtube.com for providing endless hours of great clips of old journey music , zoo cover music , and new journey concerts in chile and las vegas . this is a great album that will move journey to the forefront of melodic rock music scene again !",102,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"listened to both cos and disappointing . many cuts are remastered , and not done well in my opinion . i will not recommend revelation , and in fact will put it in my very next garage sale !",34,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"all that i can say about journey revelation , is that steve perry should be honored . the vocals done by ariel pined on this ad are outstanding . obviously , ariel has studied steve perry . not only vocally but physically as well . he sounds and looks like him . i bought this ad not knowing what to expect as i have bought other journey cos in the past during steves absences . this one however has amazed me . it took me back in time and if you close your eyes and listen , steve all of the sudden appears . excellent job ariel ! . this man was journeys best choice in a replacement vocalist . this ad is simply awesome . i hope that ariel decides to make his home a terminate one with journey in the cos to come . jonathan cain is still the best around , the band sounds great . with revelation , they have themselves a true gem .",149,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009UC7NO,"jerry onlyfor the love of all that is unholy , enough is enough . this is without a doubt the most ridiculous cover album ever conceived . give the moron your by buying the box set , downloading in the doorway from static age , and be done with it .",48,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009UC7NO,"seriously , this is a lame and blatant attempt to sucker fans out of their money . i have never been so disappointed in something that carried the misfits logo on it . i am a fan of the danzig era , i am a fan of the michael graves era . i even like the current lineup with jerry , dez , and robo . i will always support the misfits no matter what , but this album is just trash . this album for one was not performed with the true spirit of the misfits in mind . this my friends was made for one purpose , an easy , cheeky way to make a buck . after three songs you will find yourself shutting it off . i actually made it to song 5 before i decided i could not take anymore . their is no vocals on this album , just cheeky casinos and piped in strings . i would put this album on the same level as the worst songs on the pac man fever album .",158,14

Kindle_Store,B00JFBNZ6G,"for regular readers of laramie frisco , you know she can weave danger , mystery , and steamy scenes together like a champ in the heaven hill series . what i love about only the beginning is that is completely different from those books . i actually read this one right after reading the latest he book , and it was a great way of coming down from such an emotional ride in that book . this book is about two celebrities who meet by chance and just spark right away . i have always been fascinated by how celebrities deal with all the gossip and untruths from the press and this book is a great peek into that world . i liked that even although they were both completely different musically , that just did not even come into play . it was their own emotional issues they had to deal with . there are some very emotional depths in this book . there is one scene where i literally cried real tears . i do not do that often but i did it here . for those who love the heaven hill books , this is completely different from that , but if you are in the mood for something a bit lighter and not as dark , it is a great read !",202,2

Kindle_Store,B004QT6ZPK,quickly but clearly drawn world and characters in a fast paced story with neatly done closure . the problem with a short story like this is you are left wanting to see further adventures . not too adult for tween or teen or ya but not too juvenile for adults .,43,2
Kindle_Store,B004QT6ZPK,"this was a short but very cute story by ilona andrews , once again featuring a strong female lead . i liked the blend of realistic embarrassment and awkwardness with the raw power . even the unlikeable characters were well - written and amusing .",39,3
Kindle_Store,B004QT6ZPK,"short and moderately funny . enjoyable like candy , but not really satisfying . similar to the other short stories that were not published in mythologies .",22,4

Kindle_Store,B004QT6ZPK,"i must own every ilona andrews book so they wool keep writing . such imagination . great character development , i want to know what is going to happen to them even after the story has finished",34,7
Kindle_Store,B004QT6ZPK,"i have not read a bad book or novella or short story by ilona andrews . so far i have loved everything they have written but this one was just sweet and fun . i did not like the bully thug , chad , that our heroine was having to date . and the date was totally unique . i particularly liked the pig and arenas reaction to said pig . i had to stifle my laughter to not disturb others in the library . this was a fun read and i am probably going to reread it later .",83,8
Kindle_Store,B004QT6ZPK,"this is absolutely brilliant . i am hopelessly addicted to ilona andrews , and i am surprisingly unperturbed that the plot lines are a little formulaic .",24,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000M06K6Q,"i bought this because i found it used for some amount of money in a shop and had seen the name out there but had no expectations for the music before listening . i played this in the car on the way home and was into the songs from the very start of the disc . this woman can really sing and covers a lot of ground from the church to the delta blues , all very well done . there is no overbearing instruments on this and her voice really shines through . i also liked the electric piano that is used on several of the cuts which was a very sympathetic backing to her vocals . not sure if she played the majority of the piano or not because ruthie and anthony farrell are both listed as having played the piano . it does not betterthis is a very good ad and i will be exploring more of ruthie foster in the future !",156,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000M06K6Q,"do yourself a favorwhether it be this album or any other ruthie fostersome amounted it or several . her voice is raw , powerful , pure , magical . what and when she sings is from the heart and soyou can hear it in her voice or watch her on stage as her joy and love of music shines through on every note , sung or not . ruthie foster is a gem and you will not be disappointed . her rendition of a sun house tune is enough to make any blues fan or any music fan a fan of hers .",98,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,i thoroughly enjoyed this soundtrack . it has the classic sound of indiana jones and is a lot of fun to listen to . john williams is brilliant in reviving one of our favorite heroes . i am so glad i decided to buy it . a beautiful soundtrack to add to your collection .,50,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"of course , film fans have high expectations when going to see and hear indiana jones films . i am not different . sadly , john williams has not created anything truly memorable in this score . it only comes to life when one hears the familiar retreads from the original . other tracks sound like jurassic park , harry potter , or superman leftovers . only does the track the adventures of mutt possess some of the spark that was the key behind the success to the first jones film . i realize that composers can revisit themselves or borrow from others , but williams usually throws in something new in each of his film compositions . i just do not hear it in crystal skull .",113,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"as expected , john williams does his usual great job on this score . i do not think this will get him an oscar , but this will hold it is own with the best of his scores . no john williams fan should pass this one up .",42,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"john williams is by far the most accomplished and successful composers in hollywood . i will stand by that till my dying day . unfortunately , ijatkotcs is not one of his greatest works . a beautiful nostalgic opening with the raiders march is about as good as it is gon na get with this one . unlike the star wars series where each character has his or her very distinctive theme music that would literally stay in your head the rest of your life , this piece of work although technically sound really has nothing signature about it . it quite frankly left me bored by the end . very different from the music of it is predecessors , which did not really surprise me at all considering the film itself does not come close to the original trilogy either . the main reason i bought this album was because the previous 3 are impossible to find today and i really was not too keen on missing a 4th time round . nothing distinctive here !",157,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"without going into too much detail this soundtrack is nothing short of great . i have only listened to it once and it is already begining to stick in my mind . what more could you ask for , this is indiana jones . even some of the newer score is fantastic . as soon as the raiders march started i began to feel like a young child once again , carefree and innocent and that is a great feeling . simply put , if the music makes you feel good inside then it must be doing everything right . thanks again john williams .",96,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"i do not care what the evil film critics say , i loved this film . the soundtrack is just as good . now i have all four of the indiana jones soundtracks . john williams is the greatest .",34,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"i listened intently when i saw the movie the other day for anything original that stood out like in the other 3 movies that is the marion love theme from raiders ; the slave mining theme and indian village themes and willie scott love theme from temple of doom ; the grail theme , father or son theme , and more but there was nothing that i heard specifically that stayed with me . i did hear a lot of familar music cues from the other movies marion theme and the grail theme surprising used extensively towards the end of the movie . just like the movie , i felt the score was rushed and williams basically phoned this in . of all his scores , this one was really lacking .",117,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"the soundtrack to indiana jones and the crystal skull is again written in the old hollywood action adventure sound , and we again thank you for it . indiana jones music hurries you thru from one threat to the next but takes the time to let it all sink in with the music taking you from one crescendo to the next . without it , indie would just be another some amountetter word . see the movie , but make sure you buy the soundtrack !",79,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"with arguably one of moviedoms finest anthems in the raiders march to build off of , john williams once again shows why he is probably the finest movie theme composers of all time . for all time indy fans , it is wonderful to hear little snippets of previous indy films worked into this score , as well as new and exciting original pieces to further the legend of indiana jones .",67,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"i was hoping to get another great indy score , but unfortunately we just get another indy score . whimsical . that is all i can say about it . most of the cues , including some of the larger action pieces just sound like indy and the gang are out having a rollicking good time keeping up with the commies . there has only a few cues where you actually feel like there has any kind of threat . williams is by far my favorite composer of all time and having listened to all of his scores countless times , he tends to borrow from himself once in awhile . in this score , i hear a little far and away , a little hook and something that i did not expect . 3min 22sec into track 13 we hear a note for note cue from war of the worlds ! ? ! ? track 4 the intersection scene 38 sec into cue . not sure what that means yet , i guess we will all know may 22nd . i after seeing the film , it means nothing . much like the movie itself . a whole lot of nothing",174,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"john williams rarely strikes out , and he has definitely not in this latest composition from indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull . the indiana jones theme is what everyone remembers . i would rank it as one of the best motion picture themes . the rest of the soundtrack is very good . there is nostalgia woven throughout this soundtrack . marion theme is back and is found in several of the tracks , whether it be a a few seconds or not . some of the last crusade music makes a return as well , at very appropriate times in the movie . i think it is an indication of how well the composition is by how well you are moved by the music and this made me recall all of the fond memories of indiana jones moments . there are some rather different themes at play but very much in tune with the theme of the film . until the other 3 soundtracks get re - released , this is your best chance to have the indy theme .",168,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"got this soundtrack for my sister for her birthday , we both love it . i ripped it to my xbox 360 elite had and we listen to it while we play halo 3 together . thanks for a great product . go john williams !",41,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,this soundtrack is awesome the best soundtrack to the best movie buy this soundtrack if your a fan of the classic movie or a soundtrack fan you will not be sorry,30,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,this is an exceptionally well done score . several of the themes literally give me chills and the orchestrations are vintage williams . this is the best score i have bought all year .,30,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"there has really two ways at looking at this . the all too familiar raiders march and map room cues are used to anchor this ad , but unfortunately there are no new cues to differentiate crystal skull from the original three movies . from one viewpoint it serves as a reminder of all the things that were good about the originals both as fun iconic films and the memorable music that accompanied each . but as an original work , this ad fails almost across the board for me . i did not want a nostalgia piece , i own the previous three scores with the new film , i wanted something updated and fresh but still part of the indiana jones universe and it does not succeed in that respect . while the trademark williams ability is here , it just seems like potential unfulfilled . a new indy jones movie soundtrack should have been a benchmark work , not solely a reminder of what once was great .",158,14
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,why all the negative comments ? this was certainly a pleasant read . i have read all in the series . found the one on piper the most entertaining . reading them in order is best but not necessary .,35,0
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,this book was a cute romance with two characters that fell for each other right at the start . the book also introduces the other members of the peregrine family and their close friends . once you have read this book you will want to know about the other members . even although there were a few errors with regards to some of the names it does not deter from the lovely story .,69,1
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"i have not read a romance novel in a while . this novel was a nice deviation from lifes seriousness . i enjoyed the character poppy . she was simply refreshing and full of life . declan had a charm that i found intriguing and i could actually feel why he was such a strong temptation for poppy . the story kept pulling me back to see what was going to happen next between the two . the book did need some editing in some spots , but i enjoyed the story and was able to overlook those . i am impressed with this first time author , and would encourage her to continue developing her writing . i am looking forward to her next story !",113,2
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"this is a sweet historical romance and the title is very misleading . declan was devastated to lose his older brother gabriel and has dedicated himself to the estate in seclusion since unexpectedly becoming the duke of hawley . after 3 years he decides to accept an invitation to spend the summer with his best friend the marquis of ashford . when he arrives he finds the marquis sister poppy in her wild garden by chance and is immediately entranced by her . poppy is a lively and bright and is also struck by declan . she has three seasons behind her and has rejected all proposals . for the first time she is fascinated by a man . there are no major intrigues . it is a gentle love story that unfolds at a summer party . the focus is on the intense attraction and growing love between declan and poppy . the writing and events are lively and keep the pages turning , perhaps in a jane austen style but with more spice . the other characters are interesting , even to the point of hoping for their stories in future . in fact , i see that poppy twin sister piper is the subject of ` seduce me please and i have just ordered my copy .",203,3
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"did an editor ever read this ? was it proofread ? the writing is clich and sounds like an adolescent girl writing in her journal . i have to agree with incognito character development , no consideration given to any consistency of point of view it switched four times in four paragraphs , no motivation , and horrendous sentence structure . i can not comment on the progress of the plot because after reading the first a percentage of the text i just quit . what a waste of some amount of money in my old life h.s. writing and writing for publications teacher this author would have been roasted by her peers during her first reading to the writers circle . their feedback would have been start over because there would have been nothing to work on improving .",125,4
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"thin plot , characters with no personality , and i do not think anyone bothered to proofread the manuscript ; spelling and grammar errors abound throughout the book and are very distracting .",28,5
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"i hate not finishing a book . but i just could not . this one , with some proper guidance and editing might have held promise , but . i could not stick around to finish it . please , before this author writes another book , please take time to edit it , spell check , and have someone look over the grammar , and more this felt like a first draft . just could not do it . it hurt too much .",69,6
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"it has been so long since i have read a good romance novel , and i was so enthralled with ruin me please i was unable to put it down . the love story between poppy and declan has just a pure spirit and true love that the entire time you are wanting to take in more and more of their powerful love . by the end of the book i was wishing i lived in that time and made me miss chivalry and genuine love , i want my own castle ruin . i can not wait for more , because not only are you drawn into the main characters romance but the supporting characters have love stories intertwined in the book as well . nicole matthews really knows how to reach the romance part of a womans heart , it was sensual , sensitive , caring , respectful , intoxicating all at once . in a time where romance is dead and divorce and heartache are the norm it is refreshing to be swept away from it all , and that is exactly what ruin me please did for me !",176,7
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"it had potential . and i forced myself through the book , hoping it would get better . i actually found misspellings in this and the grammar structure was horrible . get this girl an editor that can help re - write portions of the book and maybe she will have something ! a book with potential is still a crappy book . my advice to the author if she reads these : keep trying and find a good editor and some readers that will give you honest and sound advice .",81,8
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"why is not there an option for zero stars ? the previous reviewers covered it i just want to add my amen . the writing is simply awful , the characters are a mess , and more , etc . it is the old rakes - and - virgins scenario taken to the extreme . like olde mrs. i , i got through a percentage and quit ; this author needs to find another career .",57,9
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,this author has made her characters so real you feel like you are part of the group . i fell asleep reading this . i could not put it down .,27,10
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"i read this book last and now want to read 2 3 again to pick up on the details that i missed that were hinted to in book 1 , while this book does not have the damsel in distress that the others do , it was thoroughly enjoyable to read . besides who would ever think of poppy as a damsel in distress . i do hope a 4th is on it is way about peyton !",73,11
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"the cover makes you think it may be an erotic novel . it is not . but i knew it was not . seems an odd cover for a historical romance . unfortunately , this book suffered from at the very least , someone to proofread it , make sure the grammar was up to snuff . it could stand a good editor too . the writing felt a little too much on the juvenile side and too dramatic . the hero and the heroine acted that way too . i am glad they allow sampling because i strongly recommend readers sample the book before purchasing .",92,12
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"i have never given a book a one star review . that was generous for this rival . how this ever received positive reviews is boggling . it was painful to read three chapters and not wonder at the age of the author and thinking maybe this was a grade school project . i could not even finish . my 13 year old writes better stories and with less repeating of the same line and phrase again and again . the reviews that rate this book good have to be friends of the author and trying to boost her up , or else this was meant for grade school .",102,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"daft punks discovery gets put through the ringer by some house and hip - hop luminaries . the resulting album , daft club , shows a wild range i lots of fun . the neptune turn harder , better , faster , stronger into a rob track , while basement jax throw whatever sonic debris they can get their hands from arabic horn samples to vocal squeals into their mix of phoenix . boris lugosi , however , does not do much for digital love . both demon and laidback luke deliver harder versions of face to face and crescendos respectively , but the slum village version of aerodynamic minimizes the wonderful baroque chords and maximizes not - so - wonderful broke rhymes . and just in case you did not get enough of one more time , there has an acoustic version . definitely a mixed bag of a remix album , but still worth checking out .",132,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"there has a reason why some songs are made available only over the internet , and it is not because they are too good for ordinary record buyers . these guest remixes might have made for nice freebies , but they do not add up to much of an album . while the 2001 source record , discovery , struck a balance between dance - floor mechanics and prog - disco kitsch , the remixes here opt for either or or , so boris dlugoschs digital love is humdrum house and gonzales too long is fantastic gimmickry . only the neptune stand between daft club and utter irrelevance . they reconstitute harder , better , faster , stronger as offbeat digital soul built around a nagging synth line and pharrell williams great falsetto . not for the first time , they are easily the best thing about a good record .",125,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"daft punk are my favourite des of all time . they come out of nowhere and have infectious songs that you cannot get out of the head . this up is just a remix album of their 2001 classic discovery . but it does nothing for me really . i am feelin the aerodynamic daft punk remix . i love the neptune but , their remix to one of my favourite songs of all time harder better faster stronger is just terrible . they should have never touched it at all . sorry neptune . the other remix by jess crabbe us way better . this album should have had more songs from their album . they are missing superhero , quais - vous , and voyager some of the best tracks on the discovery album . this album has the same song just remix . aerodynamic has 3 remixes 2 too many , they should have left something about us alone . i love daft punk but please come with new material so i could forgive you for this dreadful piece .",161,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"i do not understand why the rating is so low . the whole album is quality . everyone is expecting a new album altogether ? well it is a remix album , everybody hates those , and this one is actually good , so shut up .",38,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"daft club is another great album from daft punk , the techno frenchmen . the theme from interstellar 5555 is on here and is truly an excellent song . aerodynamic is almost better than robot rock but not quite . the neptune and basement jax mixes of harder better faster stronger and phoenix really add to the unique flavor of the albums techno . the only song i hate on here is number ten , a rap remix of a good song that makes it look like crap .",82,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"i got this ad recently and have listened to it several times . it is a nice remix to a bunch of daft punks great songs . it is smooth and slowed down with some more vocals in places . very nice ad to listen to . it is not hard techno , but it is a good ad . i definitely recommend it !",55,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"simply , nothing i can complain about . some great sounds were released in this album , and of course , a must have for daft punk fans alike . starting off with the overture is a great idea , and is totally the daft sound we have all come to know and love in their first release of homework so many years ago now , and as we all still know their ever adapting sounds are also quite aparent in this release . mostly remixes of thier 2001 released album discovery this verydisco ad , covers every sound you want to hear from funk to house back to funk . lyrics carry us through the whole way . the punks own re - creations in aerodynamic , and crescendos are a great sample of their early work . some songs on this album should not have been toyed winsome amounting phoenix i will admit , my personal fav from homework but aside from that , sit back and enjoy the sounds that other artists have loved enough to remix , and i loved enough to keep me comming back for more .",174,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"i could practically count the tracks i liked on this album on one hand . although i do agree with some of the reviewers here , harder , better , faster , stronger was one of the better tracks because i like the neptune . i also like the aerodynamic remix by slum village . my favorite track of all time ? aerodynamic ! the tracks that actually made me mad was crescendos , the slow version of too long , and the slow version of one more time . i liked them on discovery , and to hear it on this album made me sick to my stomach . i think the saying , often imitated , never duplicated goes with these tracks , although they did not try to duplicate . and something about us ? they did not even have to touch it . it was fine the way it was . they had some okay remixes , but it lost steam as it went on .",145,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"daft club is a remix album by daft punk . some of the songs were already placed on their discovery album , for example , aerodynamics , which is a song that they have been remixed and rearranged with it is order . the overall style of the album lines in parallel with those of their previous efforts . besides the songs on the album appear to be a bit more crunchy than any other daft punk albums .",71,13

Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"yes , i liked the story a lot . in fact i did not want it to end . blackbird , by anna cary , is written in second - person narrative , a style i enjoy reading . i found the story to be exciting , fast and heart pumping with an abundance of twists , turns and surprises that should satisfy the craving of just about any adventure junkie . who could not find interesting the situation a young adult female finds herself in : semi conscioussome amounting on subway tracks with a train approaching , and not remembering how she got there or , even , who she is . so , why not five stars ? because a lot , of the story , was left unexplained , and , it ended abruptly . i suspect much will be divulged in the next installment , although . and , i truly do not like it when purchasing a sequel is necessary for fulfillment .",137,0

Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"this book has the strong female character and yes she is fighting for her life in this story , but there is a thrilling mystery about this book that sets it apart from other young - teen novels . it had you wanting to turn the page to find out what will happen next . what does the tattoo mean , why was she on the tracks , who can she trust , are just some of the answers you can not wait to find out in this book .",80,2
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"this book is not recommended . do not waste yur time reading it . without spoiling the plot it seems to be about a late teenage female without a memory of where she came from , how came to be on los angeles subway rails , or even her name . throughout the book she trying to find answers while running around metro la having barely credible adventures . mildly interesting but but nothing is resolved . i found this most unacceptable . mostly i found it immature . i remember writing stuff like this in middle school . my teachers always criticized it as being too undefined and unresolved .",99,3

Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"my 16 year old daughter read blackbird . she enjoyed it and wanted to share her thoughts : this book was intriguing from the start . it is told in second person , which is unusual , and a little weird . it was different . not bad , but definitely different . it was interesting to read a book where the main character has no idea who she is . and we have no idea who she is . it was strange . the book itself was not really scary , but when she starts to figure stuff out i if you actually pause to think about it i it is freaking terrifying . overall , this was not my favorite book , and i did not absolutely love it , but i did enjoy it .",115,6
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,it was too young for me . story line was cliche and that ending came out of nowhere . i would have liked to known a lot more .,26,7
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"in 1924 , richard connell won the o. henry memorial prize for the short story the most dangerous game . this story was the forerunner of many stories , books and movies such as john woos 1993 film hard target , starring jean - claude van damme . blackbird is an extended , modern , urban , ya version of it . since the most dangerous game has been required reading for decades in many schools , there has no need to repeat the plot here . the book is written in a mix of points of view and a mix of fonts to help the reader focus . i found it acceptable , but it lacks the punch of the short story , the horror of john souls the manhattan hunt club an adult version , and the skill of thomas perry dead aim yet another version . in short , there has a familiarity for the reader and the book is designed for a niche audience . it may work for that audience , but may not appeal to any other , such as adults like myself who enjoy ya novels but are accustomed to stronger fare .",175,8

Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"this is quite a thriller ! the story opens on a girl who comes to call herself sunny and all she knows is that she has a weird blackbird tattoo . she does not know who she is , where she came from , and more as the story unfolds there are tons of twists and surprises , which i do not want to spoil . the plot starts right on the first page and then does not ever let up . it has some amazing characters , and descriptions that made me feel like i was right in the middle of the action . it is also very age appropriate , which is great ! although the main character is a girl , this has enough action and adventure that i think it would also be appealing to teenage boys as well . overall , this one is a great read !",134,10
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"i almost unfed this book . almost . maybe the fact that it is not too long helped keep that from happening . i had a really hard time getting into the book in the beginning . i felt like everything was random and i hated feeling so into the dark . but , things started picking up and i really ended up liking it . probably the most important thing to not about blackbird is that it is written in second person . that might be really hard to get past while reading . i know i had some trouble with it . once i got more used to it , i really think it adds the story and helped me understand more about how the main character felt . the only thing that bothered me is that the point of view changes a few times in the book , which made it a bit confusing . the book is full of action , which i love . it is definitely exciting , and once the story picked up it did not take long to read . the ending left me really wanting to know more about all the mysteries surrounding the main character and how everyone is connected to each other .",191,11
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"anna cares blackbird is a mishmash of different stories : amnesia , on the run , people want to kill person , trying not to get distracted by the second person point of view . i mean , i liked it in the sense that it was a fast paced , easy read . there were a few turns although the turns were not surprising . i am not a big fan of second person point of view though . i think i have read one book recently where it was used well but i found it a bit distracting here . to be fair although , the main character nameless girl does not know who she is . also , not every chapter is in that point of view . anyway , i am already looking at picking up the second book in the series so it has piqued my curiosity to see where it goes .",130,12
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"this is another book that did not work for me . i have a feeling it is also another one that many people will like , but for me just did not click . what killed it for me was 2nd person tense . it just made the story too hard to fall into . maybe if the tense were flipped things would have been different . i ended up not finishing this one after a percentage . i have heard that it does get better , but tense aside the story was not working for me either . it just came off as too much and i do not think enough plot was thrown in .",102,13
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"not my usual cup of tea , but blackbird surprised me with the authors ability to pull off this particular style . the story turned out to be quite compelling and although i do not think i would pull it out again for a second read , this was a solid piece of entertaining ya fiction . i was guessing throughout , trying to figure out who to trust and how this could possibly end .",68,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"beautiful . simply beautiful . his vocalssome amountyrics , arrangementsall spectacular . this music runs the gamut from haunting , to yearning , to just good fun . this may be his best ad to date !",31,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"first off his voice is spectacular ! jaw dropping ! could listen to it all day . secondly the lyrics are beautiful he named this album correctly and the music is over all great . there is only one song i would change . tell me what you want is a duet and does not need to be . teddy sounds great , songs great , but her voice does not live up to his and it ruins the song for me . andrea bacilli throws mismatched duets onto his albums sometimes too like romania and it drives me crazy . that aside , this ad is a must own ! it is gently country without being in your face country . which can be fun too if you are in the mood for it , not dissing on country . the highlights are the keith banish looking for that girl , an instant classic , and the haunting take care of yourself , stunning ! do not miss out on this album , it is a must own ! at the very leastsome amount through the mesome amounts and download a few . start with take care of yourself and looking for that girl .",177,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"i am a fairly new teddy thompson fan . first heard him in a nick drake tribute concert . lovely singing voice and this album showcases that voice at it is best so far . although separate ways and the eponymous first album , teddy thompson are better brink of love and separate ways are beautiful songs that have no equal on this new album ; his voice on bella has never sounded lovelier . is he trying to channel roy prison on take care of yourself ? teddy albums are consistently well written and performed with terrific back up vocals rufus and martha wainwright and musicians richard thompson . this is a good solid album . maybe a little more produced and commercial than priors , but worth listening to and purchasing .",119,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,saw him opening for rufus wainwright . he was amazing . immediately bought the album and have it on repeat ever since .,21,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"a chip off the old block , teddy carries on the tradition of his parents , british folk - rock legends richard and linda thompson . his vocals evoke the open - throated soul of boz scares , the heart - on - the - sleeve romance of richard hawley , and the ache of roy prison . excellent production by david kane wraps bella beautifully . a thumping rhythm section joins with cosmopolitan instrumental touches such as subtle strings , a clacking xylophone , and reverb - drenchedsome amount - string guitar figures , to build a layered listen , all good . if only thompson had the lyric skills of his dad , bella would be an all - round winner . but most of the songs overstate the obvious , devoid of metaphor , simile , or poetry , for example , home : home is where you go when you need to know wherever you roam , you can always go home . huh ? if you do not listen too closely , bella is one guilty pleasure after another .",143,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"i confess it : i am a big teddy thompson fan . i just think he has a major talent that is not getting nearly enough attention . but i find this new album is only at a good level . his earlier worrisome amounting separate ways and a piece of what you need , are so extraordinary that the comparison bar is very very high for this guy . he has a brilliant performer , however , and any of his stuff is enjoyable . great voicesome amountreat songs , beautiful arrangements .",80,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,this is teddy thompsons strongest collection of tunes . it has the lyrics we have come to expect . he has in great voice . and the arrangements seem to have some bite . check it out .,31,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00002R0MA,"when i first bought this album from outcast my expectations were high , especially after hearing b.o.b. being a fan of their previous album aquemini i thought that stakonia would be just as good or even better . after a full listen i was really wishing i could return this album chocked full of mediocre tracks . with the exception of b.o.b , so fresh , so clean , ms. jackson , humble mumble , and the interlude drinkin again , most of the album falls short of going anywhere beat wise . i only gave this one 3 stars being that the tracks that are good make up for the bad ones . really a big letdown from these two guys that i used to respect in the hip - hop community .",120,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00002R0MA,"outcast is simply great . with every ad they become more versatile . it is like with every album they try not to outdo other artists , but they would rather outdo themselves . every album seems to be better and better . i hope outcast stay in the game for a long time to come because i see outcast evolving into the greatest rap band ever . atlanta is the place for rap , rob , soul , rock , hip - hop , and acid jazz . outcast is an example of the talent that will be seen coming out of atlanta in the year 2000 and beyond .",94,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00002R0MA,"in the pass , when you listen to outcast , you tend to zone out and play the ad over and over because the grooves are goofing . well , this is not the case with this latest ad from the dirty south . it lacks all the things that made the first albums so greatenergy . everything is either overdone or not well done . it is still worh owning if you are a diehard fan .",72,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00002R0MA,"this album is one of the best hip - hop albums ever . i first got this back in 2000 when it first came out . i was only 12 years old . i have to admit , when i first got it , i did not like it because i did not appreciate real music when i heard it , and growing up in the hood , i was used to listening to crunk , club music . but as i listened to it , i fell in love with it . i am 16 now , and outcast are my favorite rappers . this album is one of the few rap albums with real meaning to it . if i had to represent hip - hop with one c.d . , this would be it . bottom line , if you are thinking about getting this c.d . , take it from me , you will not be sorry .",133,13

Kindle_Store,B0081KRM52,"this book is a good beach or lazy day read . the characters are beautifully written and complex , although much of the book was too predictable . the dating experiences are spot on although . it also could use another pass at the editing table . overall a good story and enthralling characters !",49,13

Kindle_Store,B00IPSZGLW,funny how things work out sometimes . what made her curious about a car accident . that was not her specialty . her specialty was really in internet crime but she often got sidetracked to less important crimes . why was her gut telling her something was wrong with this accident ? hacking her way into places she had no business getting into this case was slowly building into a national threat . i hate it when reviewers give the entire plot away so i will say no more about that . it was a credible plot of greed and espionage . it could have used a bit more editing so the chapter started at the beginning of the page . character and scenic descriptions were on the edge of too much but passable . i expected a bit more of a romantic interest with one person or another but that did not happen and the end got a little confusing but maybe that is just me . a good book . i would read this author again .,163,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"oh my , she has done it again . aura mcdonalds new album is every bit as breathtaking as her previous three , but made all the more exciting with some surprising song choices . john layers my stupid mouth is probably the oddest choice for inclusion , but ms. mcdonalds rendering is the highpoint of the album . as always , her extraordinary acting skills shine through , particularly on god give me strength and the tongue - in - cheek i want to get married . the only weak point : adam gutters dividing day ; it is a beautiful song and is , of course , beautifully sung , but it creaks along in this incarnation . regardless , aura mcdonald has bestowed upon the world another stellar album to enjoy , marvel at , and keep us satiated until her next go - around .",121,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"the spiralling clarity of her voice needs stringsbut nonetheless for fans this is a splendid album of mostly little known songs . her first two cos are more accessible and dramatic , but for those of us starved for the perfect soprano singing songs of great range and depth , this is an addition to collections to be brought out on cold nights when you stoke the fireplace and make popcorn and seek warmth from within .",75,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"i was intrigued when i heard aura mcdonald tell her audience during a recent performance in san francisco that her next ad would be a compilation of popular music written by new and established singer or songwriters . having followed her career for ten years now , and seen her perform with the san francisco symphony , the los angeles philharmonic , as well as her usual 5 - piece combo , build a bridge is a refreshing departure from the music for which ms. mcdonald is renowned . overall , the selections on build a bridge are well - chosen songs that showcase her beautiful instrument around lovely arrangements in a new way . impressively , ms. mcdonalds voice is warmer and richer than on any previous recording and i have listened to nearly every one countless times . have you ever walked the length of a bridge and been surprised and happy when you reached the end ? listening to this ad is like that .",149,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"aura mcdonald is a great singer and a wonderful person . she can make an art product out of worthless song that otherwise can only be used for empty driving . her personal investment makes diamonds out of coal . but there is inevitable question of whether it is worth it . is it worth it to invest in dust ? not to say that all songs on this album where bad until ms. mcdonald inflated them with her passion , but how much higher she flies when she is helped by the genius of nellie mckay . it looks like ms. mcdonald is afraid to apply herself to the works worthy of her genius . let us hope that she will find the road in her next album .",120,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"i am confused by amazons review think this is a beautiful album . it features auras trademark surprising song choices and nuanced interpretations . i think the reviewer who said that auras interpretation of the nellie mckay song was completely straightforward should have another listen . one of auras biggest gifts aside from her incredible set of pipes is her dramatic ability , her ability to communicate such a wide range of colors and emotions . meanwhile , i am still waiting for aura to record the wonderful set of 7 deadly sins songs she sang at hankel hall a couple of years ago . please , aura , please !",101,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,this is a great collection of songs for is . mcdonald . i particularly like the neil young song my heart but it is the two songs written by the late laura gyro that have caused me to think that not since the fifth dimensions marilyn mccoy has there been a voice so perfectly suited for gyro songs . perhaps a collection of gyro songs will come our way later in her career .,69,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"this album has not quite gotten the critical praise that i think it deserves . mcdonalds daring reach into new territory , breaking out of her more traditional sounds , is refreshing . i love the american songbook , but build a bridge reveals that the tradition of great songwriting did not end in 1960 and is not restricted to the broadway stage . these songs are all nuanced , intelligent , and haunting . her voice is superb and brings each song to a new level , helping us appreciate lyrics as simple as bein green and as dramatic as tom cat goodbye in a whole new way . we miss some of the vocal gymnastics of previous albums , but the texture of mcdonalds voice actually sounds richer and deeper when attached to a simple melody and paired - down orchestrations . for all that is been said about build a bridge compared to her other albums , it just might be her most beautiful .",149,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"some of these cuts are really bizzare and not very melodic . i would like to believe that only aura could pull this off , but i am finding myself skipping many of them because they simply do not appeal to me . too bad . plus , i have seen her perform in person , and i just saw a new years performance of some of her work live at lincoln center , and i was so turned off by her personal opinions i turned it off . i am not interested in hearing the personal pines of entertainers ; that is not what i am paying for . i am paying to be entertained . get off the soapbox aura . i will not be purchasing anything else by this artist .",120,11

Kindle_Store,B005G4WUSU,"oh my god ! can you say drama , sex , murder and more this is an amazing story of the streets . ian ice bailey runs the streets and eliminates anyone in the way . kiki is a female version of himself and the two do some damage ! kiki has many men wanting to love her but tariq is her heart but circumstances do not allow them to be together . many other characters have great story lines such as jazeera , ryan , landon who kind of fades away , wondering if he returns later on ? loved it ! you will not be dissapointed ! author on the rise !",95,3

Kindle_Store,B005G4WUSU,"i have had book one of the thin ice series for quite some time now . after discovering that i was 12 books behind in the series , i was a little hesitant to begin . after hearing how good it was from various friends and family members , i decided to give it a go . i have not looked back since . thin ice is not just a series ; it is an urban soap opera . in book one , we meet ian ice bailey . ice is feared . his name rings in the streets and he is not to be played with . unfortunately for kiki and her best friend , tweety , they have not gotten the message . thin ice part 1 was a rollercoaster of a ride . the characters were in depth . the storyline flowed well and kept me on the edge of my seat . ice is one of those characters you love to hate and hate to love all at the same time . there were some minor editing issues but nothing that took away from the book . i am definitely looking forward to reading the rest of this amazing series ! 5 stars !",181,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"i am a big fan of bam margery , so when i saw this album , i was pretty happy about it . it has some good tracks on it . some of my favorites include soul on fire by him , cold black days by atrocity , king of rock roll by daniel lioness , and familiar realm by cky . the album has a good collection of rock favorites , but i have to admit that i was excepting more . half of these bands i would never even heard of before . but i guess that is good because if you hear a new band , it can turn you on to a new style of music . but anyway , if you want a nice collection of rock favorites , than you want viva la bands .",123,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"i love this album because bam chose 21 different bands that are all kick ass ! and what has cool is that i have never heard of most of these bands but they definitely got my attention now . my favorite tracks are familiar realm by cky , i do not care as long as you sing by the beefsteaks , and lost boys by the 69 eyes rocks !",63,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002G3A,"wow ! i am speechless . this ad is one of pure perfection . jann arden is a master of words ; a lyrical genius . her songs talk to the heart and come from the soul , and her voice is angelic beyond description . insensitive is not a song to listen to when you are in a great mood ; i am near tears every time i listen to it . good mother is a beautiful and up beat song about a woman who has everything , but has never wanted something so bad . the only singer out there that can compete with the lyrical value is melissa etheridge . buy this ad . you will not regret it .",108,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002G3A,"i heard insensitive on pandora radio and was hooked . found the ad in a used ad store , so i bought it . i have just about worn it out . jann arden says one of her inspirations growing up was karen carpenter . mine , too . gardens voice is not as velvety or as purely perfect as carpenters . certainly the arrangements are not as lush . but gardens voice is more immediate . she seems more worldly , been - there - done - that , although never too jaded to sing her signature good mother . if you enjoy karen carpenter , joni mitchell , dar williams , sara marseilles , anna malick , beth orion , et al , you will probably enjoy jann arden .",102,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000038IDT,"if you think this is another rap rock album , your wrong . not only does it blend that it also adds in techno . i find a lot of these songs very good because they actually do not sound like anybody else . mad props tommy lee , you rock",45,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000038IDT,"this is by far the best thing tommy lee has ever done . motley was terminally bad lee was the best thing going for that band and he should have stayed on the methods hip - hop tip instead of going with the limp alternative rock on never a dull moment . who the he shall cares clearly stands as the best track . incredible lurching rhythm , crunching guitar . this song shreds and the message is right on who the he shall cares or where the . you come from ? . even snoop delivers with a smooth rap . the other songs on this album are surprisingly well made hypocritical , new skin , metamorphosis . i do not know if you would call get naked a song , but it sure is crazyand very dirty . proposition . you is more like an old school hip - hop trip and an engaging rant against pigalettos . i even like the techno exercises at the end of the album by scott kirkland . if you can not vibe to this then you must not like kickin hip hop metal .",166,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000038IDT,"before tommy lee jumped on the post grunge sensitive rock bandwagon of today with never a dull moment , he released this album of his new band after he quit motley crue in 1999 when rap - metal or nu - metal was the happening thang or something among those lines . methods of mayhem consists of lee playing a variety of instruments and attempting to rap hearing him talk like a thug in interviews ticks me off so bad , he couls talk like a normal person any other time , now he has just trying to cash in on whatever fad is in , and that really gets to me considering this is the guy who made me want to drum along with numerous guest spots from lil kim , kid rock , fred durst , and anyone else whose spotlight has since dimmed . the songs are repetitive , dull , boring , and honestly stupid and do not offer any kind of substance or showcase any of the talent that we all know lee really possesses . all in all , methods of mayhem is undoubtedly one of the worst albums i have ever had the displeasure of hearing , and this just goes to show you that no matter what may be in at the time , you should not quit your day job .",204,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000038IDT,"i will be straight with you , if you are expecting motley crue music , you are wrong . this is like kid rock , except with more uses of the turntable . this is where in my mind , the album fails the most . honestly , who would prefer electrified noise over a good guitar solo ? as far as lyrics go , there has some originality new skin and metamorphosis , but most of the words take on a lame idea that tommy lee is a gangster . another failure is the reliance on other rap artists to appear on songs that have nothing to do with what these artists have to say , as in new skin . sex is also a downside , seriously , a grown 35 year old should be a bit more mature than talking about getting naked . but all in all , this is a good album worth a listen to and comes through in certain circles . if you are a hardcore crue fan although , you may want to stay away from this mayhem .",161,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005JSIE,si se came out very strong with this ad . i always judge a ad based on my ability to listen to the entire thing the whole way through . i can do this without a doubt . slip away pulls you into the ad immediately . by the time you get to bizcocho margo you are really feeling the music . and then the rest just flows on and on . each song certainly leaves you wanting to hear a little more . if you want to listen to something to chill out twosome amounted this ad . you will not be disappointed . you will definitely be pleased !,98,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005JSIE,"i did not know what to expect when i bought this visit was one recommended by amazon that i decided to take a chance on after sampling the clips and reading the reviews . it is not the kind of music that i have a lot of in my collection so it took a few listens for me to really appreciate it . it is good music to put on while i am writing or working on projects at working not overpowering music with heavy beats , and more but some tracks have the power to really uplift my mood and re - energize me . my favorite tracks are : the raincarol is voice is hauntingly beautiful and i love the beat of the music in this song ; my sol gorgeous instrumental ; dolemitecatchy , fun track , makes me want to get up dance everytime i hear it cuando . i would absolutely recommend this disc to my friends who like electronica or house or mixed beats because this group mixed genres of music to create their own sound .",169,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005JSIE,"side rocks ! i love this album , i love this band , they are fantastic live , they are fantastic all around . no 30 second snippet can give you a feel for how slick this music is . it is all over the place . the songs take twists and turns but they are sexy , smooth and easy turns although , not jerky and wierd . carol is voice is amazing and the live strings and percussion give it an organic feel that gets lost in a lot of todays music . everyone i have ever played this album for bought it . hip hop fans , latin music fans , pop fans , music fans across the board . every rating so far is a 5 dagnabbit . buy it , immediately .",113,12

Kindle_Store,B004XD9IZS,"i was hoping this would be as good as the first with priscilla wild ways and unforgetable humor . i was not disappointed . in the new book priscilla gets tied up with romance , duels , and a kidnapping . all done with a flare that the author can do just right ! i enjoyed the humor and wit that comes with these books and how the author relates to teenagers is great ! i can not wait to see if there is a next one !",78,0

Kindle_Store,B004XD9IZS,my 10 year old daughter loved this series . i got the first one for her because it was free or some amount of money and she finished the series in a few weeks .,30,4
Kindle_Store,B004XD9IZS,the story has a twist to it . the mother was pregnant but probably it was not that because they probably got her pregnant by them placing the embryo in the body because they said that she was 9weeks pregnant and they were away for away about 9 weeks,47,5
Kindle_Store,B004XD9IZS,"while this book , along with the first in the series can be read and enjoyed by a wide audience , this author is particularly gifted in storytelling to the tween or early teen audience . my 12 year old daughter loves these books . the pacing of the story is very well done , again keeping pace with the younger set , although there were passages that left me laughing out loud and having to explain to those around me what was so funny . keep up the great work !",82,6

Kindle_Store,B004XD9IZS,"i am writing this on behalf of my eleven - year - old daughter , who just finished kiss of life last night . i have never heard her laugh so hard and so often as she did during these two books . it got to the point where other people in the house started growling at her and she would run out of the room to laugh or stuff a pillow over her face . her only gripe is that the book seemed to end on something of a cliffhanger and she was frustrated that book 3 is not yet available .",92,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"this set is truly one of those rare deals that is hard to pass up . fischer recorded these symphonies for nimbus over the course of 14 years . the results are excellent , all digital recordings made in the hall where haydn was in residence for a large portion of his life . brilliant has secured the rights to these recordings , and now offers them in a handsomely packaged box . each ad is in a sturdy envelope , and the liner notes are informative . i own period performances of several of these symphonies from trevor pillock and the english concert , and fischer interpretations are worthy contenders in my opinion . fischer uses modern instruments combined with a period style of playing which is a very appealing combination . i have enjoyed every disc in this 33cd collection . amazons new and used partners frequently offer the entire set for under some amount of money at that price , you truly can not afford to be without this set .",155,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"listening to this album morning and evening commutes over the last several months has been one of the great musical experiences of my life . the music itself has been unfailingly interesting , moving , delightful i even the neglected early and middle symphonies . and the playing : beautifully balanced and in tune , sometimes breath - taking brilliant where did fischer find those horn players ? , and often touching . the unobtrusive shaping and molding of the individual lines and the ideal tempos nothing driven or hasty , but everything flowing and unsentimental make this a model of selfless music - making . since this collection is often available at very low prices , there has no reason to pass it over !",108,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"the playing of the astro - hungarian haydn orchestra is clean , articulate and totally professional . in short , one could not ask for a better orchestra to undertake this massive project . adam fischer primary strength is his always - excellent choice of tempt . unfortunately , he too often opts for a generic reading , missing many opportunities to turn a more beautiful and elegant phrase . also , there are many passagesalways in forwhich are poorly balanced this could certainly be the fault of the producer or even the recording venue , but surely mr. fischer approved the final edits ? . overall , this is an impressive collection which deserves to be heard by everyone who loves the music of josef haydn . terence razor 03 - 16 - 10",117,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"i can only echo the praise of the other reviewers . excellent recordings and performances in general . only note that for the london symphonies , the sound quality is quite poor these seem to be made earlier . but since i have several other recordings of these , i do not mind so much . all of the early and middle works are recorded excellently",59,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"anyone who associates classical music with forbidding profundity and lurking snobbishness should drop their needles or switch their ipods onto a haydn symphony , and unconsciously begin to tap their feet and nod their heads to the experimental glee and unpretentious freshness of this music . adam fischer heroic complete recording has endless glories , and he avoids both the tip - toeing authenticity of many period instrument conductors and the humorless , bland beauty of the modern approach . instead , we get unfettered , joyous music - making which captures the spirit of haydn . fischer folksy , ragtag 18th century big band is full of personality : witty string soloists , wild oboes , a groovy timpani , a bumptious brass section . if you are new to haydn , you can still feel safe buying this thoughsome amounting other reviewers , i recommend looking for better bargains than amazons price ; i can not think of many human beings for which haydn music would not be appealing once they get to know it .",153,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"classical music has always been an important part of my life , and i have about 300 classical cos . in november 2005 i purchased this 33 - ad set as a gift for my daughter and her husband . i opened it to sample it and was so pleased that i bought another for myself . i will leave a more technical review to the many others who have commented except to say that , in spite of the use of modern instruments , the intent was to create a faithful sound not unlike a performance in haydn day .",92,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,this set of recordings is part of the larger box called the complete symphonies - symphonic cycles of the great composers . it was originally eight different nimbus box sets .,27,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"i am no haydn expert as others who have written reviews obviously are . nonetheless , the recordings are brilliantly clear , and i am thoroughly enjoying the set it will take awhile to go through all of them !",34,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"it is a great set , and you do not get this kind of good deal very often . the sound is clear and rich ; the playin is vivid and beautiful . i would recommend this set to any haydn fans !",37,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"i am a student musicology in leven belgium so i need to buy as much cos as possible . in a shop called kruidvat in belgium and the netherlands the brilliant cos often are for sale on very low prices . today i could buy this set for 5 , which is really nothing compared to it is quality . i am now listening to symphony i 96 because we treated that one in college and i find it a very appealing recording ! if you are in belgium and you can buy this set , do not hesitate !",90,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"simply perfect ! this is a haydn symphonies , played on modern instrument brightly and vigorously . do not miss it !",20,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"all of franz joseph haydn symphonies conducted by adam fischer and the auto - hungarian haydn orchestra at a bargain basement price ? i was there four years ago , and it was one of the best purchases i have ever made . dennis prayer says bach taught him how to pray and haydn how to laugh . while i can not vouch for that , i have enjoyed hundreds of hours of haydn , my favorite composer . one can not go wrong . when my local orchestra , the new hampshire music festival , finally played a hayden symphony after nine years of my attending , it was a blessed relief . but i had to say that , pace the woody allen movie bullets over broadway , i was prepared to kill if they had screwed it up . i take my haydn very seriously . so should you , too . enjoy all 104 symphonies . you would be crazy not to .",140,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"all the other reviewers are right about this set . but i would add one thing , according to the notes , the earliest symphonies in this set were written when haydn was already 25you do not have to assume that the first part of the set is of little interest . so go get it !",53,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"these symphonies were originally released by nimbus and in their present incarnation are an absolute steal at the price that brilliant is charging . for the most part i prefer many of the interpretations of adam fischer over those of anal donate . it is not just the modernity of the recordings but i feel that this conductor has gotten the spirit of haydn into his bloodied that of his most excellent orchestrabetter than donate and many , many others . run , do not walk , to purchase this bargain set of some 30 odd discs and you will not be disappointed . very , very highly recommended to all aficionados of haydn symphoniesthe ingenuity and constant reality of tunes of papa haydn simply astound ! timothy inmate ottawa canada",127,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"i am extremely pleased with this wonderous set . the sound is very rich and colorful , and the astro - hungarian haydn orchestra displays a central european sound lustrous strings , tasty oboes , and more while providing all the drama , flair , decisiveness of the best performances of haydn symphonies . there has plenty of bite and energy in the fast movements i but still genteel and much lovelier than most of the the period - instrument groups and far superior in performance and sonics over the tired old donate set . i purchased fischer complete haydn symphonies for quite a bit more when they were available on a nimbus import now defunct last year , and for [ this money ] this bountiful reversal of haydn delightful symphonies is now a steal . highly recommended !",120,14
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,really enjoyed the book looking forward to series 2 . all 6 books were really great . it is not your average vampire book,21,0
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"sorry , too many flashbulbs of realization about all the unexplained mystery moments in the four prior books , too many characters crashing to earth or into lava or whatever and then rising unhurt in the next chapter , too many bad guesses about who the bad guy really is from a heroine who was supposed to have been a trained police officer no less . the first four of the five books were intriguing , not this one and not a bad batting average after all . kieran done for now and i am done for good .",91,1
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"an amazing series that i could not put down . get ready because i promise this is not what you were expecting ! drama , mystery , romance it has it all . get ready to spend a little although because there is a lot of book in the series but your hooked with book 1 series 1 and can not stop !",55,2
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"what can i say , another amazing book in the kiera hudson series . this one made me laugh , made me cry had me on the edge of my seat the entire time . i think i chewed down every last one of my nails by the time i was done lao i am proud to say my suspicions about elias munn were dead on although the reveal had me in tears , i am not ashamed to admit it ! i would recommend this book to anyone who will listen to me , but would suggest reading the series from the beginning . it is well worth your time . but be prepared , mr. o'rourke has a way of totally sucking you in to his stories and evoking a wide range of emotions is the span of the story you will lose track of time i i am very much looking foward to the next kiera hudson series . this author has landed firmly on my fans list i do not see that ever changing . i am totally ok with that !",173,3
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"well , kind of getting a little tired of kiera loosing her sherlock holmes vision when it comes to the biggest climaxes of the series . she is starting to loose it for me . yes , i read and liked the book , but i felt the last couple books found kiera loosing some of what made her special in the first place . still . yet a cliffhanger ending . again ! i did buy the next book , but i stopped after that one . i can only tolerate so much , and cliffhanger endings just annoy me . a solid it is ok 3 star for me .",97,4
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"vampire hollows kiera hudson series one book five i think this well may be the best series i have ever read and tim o'rourke my favorite author . you definitely must start with book one and read them all . you will not be disappointed . for once the ending was not rushed or fizzle out . all of the characters were fleshed out and really interesting . they changed and matured . the heroine was never whiny , immature or mindlessly rushed into danger . there were laughs and heartache , romance , betrayal , twists , turns , surprises and not - stop action . i do not know what to do while waiting for the next book .",105,5
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"while reading i can not believe the author did what he did . especially towards the end . that is when i wanted to take the book and destroy it because he did not even give me a heads up of what was going to happen . when they stood in front of the elders and then kira turned to seth and when she turned was when i was caught off guard . no ! i screamed as if it was going to change . i read and re - read it to make sure i was reading it right because i could not believe they killed him . so i am going to be honest i wanted to curl up and cry and not read the rest . that is when you know it is a good book when the book takes an emotional toll on you whether it is happy , sad , angrysome amountove or hate . but i put my big girl panties on pushed through the heartache and read on . which of course i am glad i did . have fun enjoying all of the emotional rollercoaster that this book will give .",179,6
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,love the series keeps me wanting more the author makes u care about the characters that is what keeps me coming back,21,7
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"this series was ok and quite overpriced . each book is really a long chapter , frequently without proper endings . the characters are one dimensional and are always yelling . made my head hurt ! they do really stupid things in order to fill the book . overall , i would not have bought these books again and definitely will not buy any of his other series , not at some amount of money a chapter . the writing just is not good enough to justify that cost .",74,8
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"i must say i just brought the five books to this series just last week and have finished vampire hollows right now , i did enjoy the thrill chase romance and mystery of wanting to know who was the big bad man but i have to say i am a little dissapointed in knowing this was not the end and now the four of them are dead flesh . i am at an aww of what this author will come up with next . i will most likely read it just because i am curious to know what happens in the sixth book , hopefully this wait is not eternal .",106,9
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"i am absolutely never disappointed by time books ! it is always a wild ride and i find myself trying to slow down while reading so i do not finish the book so fast , because i know i will just want more ! now i am eagerly awaiting kieran next adventure !",44,10

Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,i found suddenly skinny day by day to be a very inspirational accounting of one womans weight loss journey . her tenacity certainly paid off and serves to show the rest of us in the same struggle how dogged determination will get us to our goals if we just make the right choices in every moment and then act on those choices . freya story will surely inspire those in need of encouragement in their pursuit of thinness .,76,1

Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,"i liked the feel of this novel , the world building , the sense of melancholy and mystery . the main character was an interesting person , with some depth and a little development . she even managed to keep from being the formulaic kick - butt heroine . my only complaint would be that it moved a bit slowly at times , and i do despise novels where it is obvious that one or more of the characters knows what is going on and refuses to tell the heroine . makes it feel like the author is just pulling my chain as long as she can . this one was not so bad , and i am glad i read it . some good seeds for a sequel there , but no horrible cliff hangers at the end . i would recommend it .",127,12

Kindle_Store,B008UGBS16,"only piers anthony could bring such a story and write with such skill that you feel as if you were inside the story itself , .",24,1
Kindle_Store,B008UGBS16,"i really enjoyed this trilogy . the stories are not particularly intellectually tasking , just simply enjoyable to read . the characters are , at times , absurd , but . hello ! . this is a fantasy ! if you like piers anthony , which i do , you will enjoy these adventures .",41,2
Kindle_Store,B008UGBS16,i was very disappointed with the first book so did not read on through books two and three . maybe it was written for young teens because it certainly seemed to be so simply written . i have read other piers anthony books and was completely surprised .,45,3
Kindle_Store,B008UGBS16,i thought it was a bit dorky . too much sex talk and boobs and not a very good story line . what did i expect ? something a bit more mature as far as the writing and storyline . piers is such a good writer i expected better .,45,4

Kindle_Store,B008UGBS16,"the trilogy takes you from the world of djinns , to wonderful lands and all the way to hades ! genies , wizards , sorceress , nymphs , magic carpets and even simba are part of this collection . can not think of a better way to spend the weekend reading with a nice cold drink on hand ! loved it",52,9
Kindle_Store,B008UGBS16,"this series is a good , quick read with a lot of pierce anthony influence very apparent . if you like anthony want novels then you will feel right at home , although i am a little concerned about the attention he pays to the human anatomy . the story is well done and the third book leaves you wanting more . overall , rain and anthony make a great writting team . i look forward to more from these two .",74,10

Kindle_Store,B008UGBS16,"this is absolute trash , it is not the piers anthony i have read in the past . i hope piers anthony got lots of money from the co writer for brining his name down so low . as bad as it is i really wonder if piers anthony even reviewed the books before he allowed his name to be put on it . over all the books are childishly writen and the plots are both predictable and weak .",74,12

Kindle_Store,B00NXCDUCM,this is a great shot read ! it is definitely worth reading it . i pretty much love all e.j. adams books !,21,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"this arrived on time and in new condition as advertised . i seen the movie playing on to over and over , so i just had to have these awesome songs no itunes or amazon mp3 search came up with the specific songs i wanted . this ad is perfect every song is in great quality",53,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,worth the wait to get on ad since it is not available digitally !,12,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,arrived on time and undamaged . i loved the movie and now i have the music to enjoy wherever i go .,20,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"all i could find elsewhere were the broadway soundtracks , which are fine , but i really wanted the exact sound from the movie . i was obsessed with this musical as a kid . so i got this album , and i am so glad i did , because it is perfect . the ad is brand new , and it is wonderful .",53,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,nice adaptation of the show to the screen . rick moran's in the best part of his career . and having ellen greene preserved on film as audrey is wonderful . one of the best musical comedy performances of the 80s . too bad the original was an off - broadway production . she deserved a tony .,50,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"i really enjoyed the music from the movie and the people who sang the songs . i looked for the sound track , and chose this ad . steve martins dentist is worth the price .",32,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"my parents and i love to watch this film together , but i can not watcha musical without singing along ! this is by far my favorite modern musical . the best track downtown skid row not to be confused with petals clarks version , this one is far catchier and very much the feeling of coming home to a less than posh neighborhood after a long day . suddenly seymour comes in second with stunning vocals from both lead characters and the theme is cute and catchy . i am so happy to see the actual soundtrack is still available , i am going to pick one up right now . hey , check out the movie , too . it is great !",109,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"i agree with the top critical review . although this ad is from the movie , it is noticeably different than the official movie soundtrack . i am glad to have it , but will reserve a 5 - star rating for when they provide a true direct copy from the movie . i mean , is not it easier , and cheaper , to simply use what you already have rather than going through the motions twice just for the audio ad ?",70,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"this is one of the best soundtracks of all time . the music , from howard ashman and alan monkey , is easily better than their work for disney . the pop influence is great . between steve martins smarmy turn as orin scrivello d.d.s. and ellen greene reprising her broadway role of audrey . this one is a must have for musical fans .",58,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"also added this digital version to our collection , as the old vinyl and cassette can not be played in my truck . the price was awesome for this new disc , and showed up right on time ! thank you for this opportunity , we recommend this seller !",43,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,it was music from the original finished film i would recomend it becase it has songs from the deleted scenes it was great,23,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,this is a great ad . every song from the movie is on this ad . the best !,16,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"the music for this show is fantastic , and the movie version is great like it much better than the broadway version although it might depend on which you heard first . ellen greene starred in the broadway play as audrey and is stunningly woodland her voice is perfect . hard to believe such power can come out of such a petite person . rick moran's can actually sing , who knew ?",71,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,it is a wonderful musical . it is the greatest . i love the rhythm and blues aspect of it .,18,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"wow , me again if you did not see my other review for the other ad then hi ! ! back to the ad . i think this ad is the best , although it is missing at least 5 songs , which i have been looking for all over and can not find now it is just the gas , mushing son , and closed for renovations , just to name a few . i but , anyway this ad is hilarious ! do not scream , please , i know this is spelt wrong i mean green mother is the best song on this ad ! i love this song all i have to say is this : if you do not own this ad then buy it !",117,14
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,when i do a pattern i not only do the stitches but i also like to compare my work along with the pictures in the book especially when i am learning a new craft such as the tatting .,38,0
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,first time tatters and crocheted can only guess or look up the images on the net . i can i imagine using these patterns .,23,1
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,"fun book . i have tatted some , could follow this easily .",9,2
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,no tatting book is ever worth it is salt that does not have pictures . not only can you not see what you are making but it is impossible to decide which pattern you want to make . it is also helpful to have the pictures to clarify instructions .,43,3
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,it is intended for a 19th or 20th century woman who knows how to tat . there are no instructions or photos or illustrations of the finished pieces let alone steps on how to get there . the language is also dated .,37,4
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,the book teaches tatting and crocheting not a big plot,10,5
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,"unfortunately , the instructions do not make a lot of sense to me without the diagrams or pictures . i wonder why the old books have images on the project greenberg site , but not in the kindle store on amazon ?",37,6
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,"book is in good condition , just as the seller described it . shipment was received promptly . thanks for good expedient service .",20,7
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,"these craft books are great , i love to find all the information i can get . i always try to learn more stitches , and creative ways to make new things . i hope you will enjoy this as much as i do . it all depends on your hobbies , and the things you like to do .",53,8
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,hard to follow . not enough illustrations or pictures .,8,9
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,this is one book that needs to have the diagrams with the written word . i am disappointed in this format .,20,10
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,"no pictures or diagrams just a lot of bla , bla , bla . ok it is free but it is just worthless !",19,11
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,it is amazingly difficult to find books with tatting patterns . i was very excited to find this one free . thank you .,21,12
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,it is okay but no pictures and not a good book for the learner . i would not recomend this for a beginner .,22,13
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,i wish there were plates with pictures included to make figuring the patterns out easier at least of the main motifs,21,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,this ad i had in 96 and i love it . played it over and over again . had to buy a new one . the shipping was fast . got it nothing wrong with it . just like i got it when i got it in 96 . faith hill she great love her . what more can i say .,54,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,i love faith hill and this ad to me is faith at her best love the songs love her voice,20,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,i enjoy listening to faith hill and this ad has a lot of her good songs . it is good for the road .,21,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"i am more into her later works . i am more of a country or pop fan . this ad was all country , i am not saying it is bad , but i enjoy her later works more . beautiful voice as usual .",37,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"it matters to me is the perfect reprieve from faiths pop album breathe . listening to the songs someone elses dream 1 and let us go to vegas 2 reminds me , as well as faiths other country fans , of that special twang that was faith hill . one of the best songs on this album is the powerful a mans home is his castle 5 . this song depicts a woman who is abused and unfairly dominated by her husband . the title track , it matters to me 3 is a heartfelt song that realistically speaks about communication in a relationship . also , the spiritual keep walkin on 10 with shelby lynne is a great number that ends the record nicely . this album is an incredible work that is bunches of fun you will love it !",128,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,i really enjoy faith hill cos . this one was just as enjoyable . it does have a good selection of songs .,20,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"you do not need to have faith to listen to this ad . she is still the queen and this ad has a good selection that proves her voice and style is very good . this is early faith hill , a little more country than her later pop .",45,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"while it does not have monster hits like take me as i am had some amount . wild one , piece of my heart , this album is more consistent overall . everything on here is at least above average . most are good to very good . i can not give this a full 5 stars , because 2 of carrie underwoods albums are significantly better and definitely earned 5 stars . however , i would have given this close to 4.25 stars had we been able to use partial stars . as far as individual songs , it matters to me gets an a from me . everything else on this album ranges from a be to a b. very consistent quality , even although there is not the mega hits as in her other albums . but that is perfectly fine , i think good to very good consistent quality is a lot better than having a mega hit and lots of mediocrity see breathe , faith albums . overall , this is a i album in my opinion , barely below an a . my favorite of her albums , with take me as i am as a close second . faith was definitely at her best in her first 2 albums .",191,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,i bought this ad to get to songs but did hear two more it do enjoy love the song of the whole ad and would buy again .,27,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"i like faiths later music up to a point , but this is my favorite of hers . i yearn for the day when she makes another album like thisafter her hit - making days are over , perhaps ? the songs are variously feisty bed of roses , you will be mine , just plain fun viva las vegas or serious a mans home is his castle , about domestic violence . there has even a gospel duet keep walkin on with the great shelby lynne . the whole feel of the album is country , albeit with a contemporary edge , very different from faiths later albums . some of the sad songs have upbeat backing music , so if you do not listen too closely you may not realise just how sad they really are . this is a brilliant album . following on from her debut take me as i am , another brilliant album , i expected more of the same to follow . it did not , but her later albums are not as bad as some would have you believe .",165,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"the songs i like on this ad : someone eles dream , let us go to vegas , it matter to me , you can not lose me and i can not do that any more . are the songs i like . faith you can do better than that . i like the song let us make love with tim . it not on this ad it is on breathe , but i like the song anyways .",65,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"i like faith hill because she is pretty and sings good songs . i like this ad . the songs i like on this ad are : let us go to vegas , the title track , and my favorite of them all you can not lose me .",41,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,love the album . i have come to accept this quality from faith hill . she has a beautiful voice that stands out above many of her counterparts in country music today .,30,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"this is proof that faith hill actually used to be a country singer . you can listen to this album straight through without skipping songstheyre all great . she has a sweet , tender , country voice and the songs are very well written . excellent album !",44,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"this album has some sassy songs along with it matters to me and i can not do that anymore , which are plaintive and lovely . a mans home is his castle is a good story song . basically this album has everything good about country on it .",44,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"gave this a 3 because of the music , the vocals give it a minus 2 since they actually distract from the awesome music . this was a good starting album but it just misses melody . the music is kick ass the entire way threw , now take away the vocals and you have a great instrumental album but the vocals leave you wanting something you can understand , it is like listening to someone gasp for air and then spitting on a microphone for an hour . hey if you are into that then by all means go spend some amount of money on it but if you want something with some melody and alot better vocalist get the end of heartache . such a great improvement not only vocally but also musically , they made the perfect decision getting the new singer , not only can you understand the new singer when he has screaming his lungs out but his voice during melodic parts is great .",154,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"man , comparing use in their early days to now i just got to say they were way heavier and better . yeah since jesse left they have not been that good anymore end of the heartache was a cool album but the newest stuff is kinda weak , howard is not that good of a singer jesse was way better . get this one is pure heavy metal unlike their new stuff this is something you can actually rock to get it they will not be heavy like this anymore !",82,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"the second disc is a big improvement , but this one is a great start . i say that big fans should own this disc , but most likely you will find yourself wanting to play alive or still breathing rather than this one . simply because it has better playing , better songs , and better production . yet , this is more raw sounding , so some people might actually like it better if they get off on that sorta thing . if you are new to the band although , i suggest starting with alive or still breathing . now , i just want to comment on some of the things i read in other reviews . first off , killswitch owns patera and besides , patera actually are not around anymore , so according to that guy killswitch now reign supreme . and , this is not how metallica should sound . long live killswitch engage !",136,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"first off i can not believe what the real metalhead from ohio said , everything besides killswitch on roadrunner is nu - metal garbage?he must not even know who has on roadrunner , what about cradle of filth ? obituary ? chimera ? decide ? are you out of your freaking gord man ? why do not you go check roadrunner roster on their website , all kinds of real metal bands on roadrunner . to the ad , best tracks are rusted embrace , vide nara , stillborn . very good album overall , not enough of it although .",81,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,hey if you like these guys check out aftershock through the looking glass it is a great ad and it has members of killswitch engage before they were in killswitch engage but it is a good ad check it,37,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"not the best band out there . got to remember they are nu - metal . not much talent here . vocals are not bad , would be nice to hear less screaming . have to agree this is not very heavy at all . for some heavy bands check out slayer , leadeth or napalm death . killswitch has some potential and i hope to see something better from them in the future",63,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"killswitch engage is one of the most amazing bands . this album is so much different from the other bands we see now . use truly standout . the element of one , self revolution , and pretty much the whole album is just an epiphany in it is works . i was speechless when i once got the ad and heard it through . i am still amazed at the effort made making this album . he has a voice with different personalities . he goes from angry to just soft structured hymns . it is mindblowing . the guitars are impossible sounding . the guitar work is so amazing , it is hard to even tell that is guitar . it is an amazing album . for fans of shadowsfall , norma jean , and you get the idea . pick this album up .",123,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"the debut album from the now hugely popular killswitch engage . this album is very good . it is the basic metalwork formula of most bands deemed generic , but it just seems so fresh and powerful . everything on this album fits perfectly together . this is an album that seems like killswitch engage put out with all of their focus . i am past my metalwork phase , but this is still a very good album . highly recommended to anyone .",75,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"firstly , for gods sake kids , if you are illiterate , no one will trust your judgement so stop writing reviews . the most important thing to have in mind before listening to this record is that the majority of the songs do not come off as catchy to the average listener . unless you have a considerably distinct and developed taste and preference in metal - core , metal , or hardcore , you are simply not going to be able to sit through killswitch engages self titled record and enjoy it . therefore , if you are a nu - metal , punk , ska . and more fan , do not listen to records like this one and expect to be entertained i and certainly do not review them , seriously . the record is consistent , repetitive , and powerful . however , it has only 9 tracks , 2 of which are not even songs and the actual songs are in my opinion , dragged out somewhat obnoxiouslysome amountasting upwards of 5 minutes , at times , seeming as if the band members forgot that their songs need a chorus . i enjoy it very much but i am not going suggest that everyone go out and buy it . if you are a big use or metal fan , this ad is definitely worth the some amount of money - some amount of money .",196,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"the guy at the bottom knows his stuff . this album in my opinion is killswitchs best by far . i can not stand the new new singers emo wine crap . if you want a pure , brutal , unrelenting , totally kick a metal album pick this up . reversal , temple from the within , stillborn . every song is great . and the best metal vocalist ever , period . if you can not stand the new killswitch like me and want to hear straight up kick a metal then pick this one up .",82,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"if you like you music heavy and intricate , then killswitch engage is the band for you . this is what metallica should be like . the sounds are straight in your face and the vocals are great screaming to singing . none of that grunting crap . the songs all seem to stay in your head hours after the ad is over . this ad just went on my top some amounts . .",68,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"it may not be worth the extra money just to get some songs you already own , but they sound a he shall of a lot better than the originals . and to those who claim they have sold out , shut up and listen to something else . this was a great ad before , but the production values are very poor , and they made a great choice to fix it up and re - release it . note : i do not know if amazon will delete this or not , but i went to circuit city a local electronic store for those of you who do not have one , check best buy and this ad is some amount of money no clue why it is so much on here , maybe because it is considered an import ?",120,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"along with alive or just breathing , this is the best album they ever done the heaviest stuff from them is here and of course their masterpiece alive or just breathing is also must have . forget their new stuff i agree too i can not stand howards emo crap stick it with jesse . if you like heavy metal and by heavy metal i mean heavy metal that is brutal this has heavy stuff influences from death metal i just love his death growls and brutal fast metalwork just get it !",84,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"ok , the guy good riffs . cheesy vocals , january 19 , 2004 reviewer : a music fan from ma who posted the statement about the cheesy vocals is obviously a new fan of kse. please take the time to read his review . my music fan from ma , if you ever take the time to read this know that use dropped your cheesy vocalist which i totally absolutely disagree with as cheesy jesse leach for new blood has been she had vocalist , the howard jones . if you listened to alive or just breathing all the way thru , you will find that jesse was a superb vocalist . even his quote opera singing . when darkness falls off of freddy against jason was jones first original recorded song with the band , so of course the vocalist will sound different - but you did not know that so you will not have to die a slow and painful death after all . i do not own this album but i do own alive and it is the greatest metal album i have ever heard so this will receive 5 stars as well . i just saw this guys review and felt that i needed to respond",186,13

Kindle_Store,B006VE8UWE,i bough this book i or i i thought it would tell me some things i did not know . it really did not . it only highlighted things i knew about relationships . i still enjoy the authors personality as she shoot straight with no chaser . but i could have save my money and read something else . this is a book for young woman who have not been out and experienced much or older woman that are just dumb when it comes to relationships !,76,12

Kindle_Store,B005FA3W8C,"since i am something of an aficionado of world war i aviation i dove into this book with glee as it is considered something of a classic in the genre . sadly , i was ultimately disappointed . the book is at least 50 pages too long and could have benefited from a competent editor . there is a long meandering section dealing with sick leave that becomes tedious and there is entirely too much cumbersome philosophizing on politics , business , and world finance . when the action takes to the air , the book is in fine form and the pages practically turn themselves . also , anecdotes about aerodrome life and the civilians encountered in the neighboring french hamlets is amusing and worthwhile . unfortunately , the book deviates from this formula too frequently . by the end of the book , i was hoping that some enterprising hun would put the main character out of his and my misery . read sagittarius rising by cecil lewis for a more nuanced account of the air war or fighting the flying circus for a breezy , thrilling look at wi aviation seen through the eyes of americas highest scoring wi ace , eddie rickenbacker .",189,1
Kindle_Store,B005FA3W8C,"i enjoyed the book very much . however , the style of writing is definitely in the early 20th century type that is very flowery and poetic . i compare the style to zane grey . i would like there to have been a bit more of a discretion of the aircraft type and style . overall a very good read . i am not familiar with the author and was wondering if , perhaps , he was writing about himself and his experiences in wi .",78,2

Kindle_Store,B00ISBFO2C,"first , i must say that i enjoyed these three books although the story could have been said in one book . i downloaded all three books , read through them and was pleased with what i read . imagine my dismay when i got to the ending and there was no closure to the story . the less female characters story was told in a one page epilogue . come on ! it was like the ending of this book was an aforethought . terrible ending to a fairly decent story . very disappointed , will not be downloading any more of this authors work . be forewarned , the ending sucks !",101,4

Kindle_Store,B00ISBFO2C,julianna foster is a little crazy ! there are twist and turns and you do not know what is going to happen next ! i loved the whole series !,25,13
Kindle_Store,B00ISBFO2C,"loved the end because i was not totally expecting it . i read a ton of books and this was not the typical romance . it brought a really interesting spin . i hated certain characters and then liked them then hated them . i agree their could have been more detail , but still worth the read .",52,14
Kindle_Store,B006LAX8K2,this thing has gone completely off the tracks ! it seriously needs editing ! what a mess and a waste of the authors and my time . the spelling is terrible ! the plot starts well but gets progressively sidetracked by the wrong words and misspelling . soon the errors outweigh the story line and you do not care what happens to the characters . better luck in the future . get an editor !,66,0
Kindle_Store,B006LAX8K2,"well this book appeared along with a group of non fiction survival stories , and so i bought it thinking it was non fiction . the description also does not give any clues that it could be fiction . i was caught out all the way up to the part when smithy shoots the bear with a flare gun . up to that point i had overlooked the grammar and style as it was an amazing story of survival , but after that , it is all i could focus on . i think it is a great story for young children , i would certainly have read it to my children along with the hardy boys , but for me , in this stable fact is far more interesting than fiction .",120,1
Kindle_Store,B006LAX8K2,this is a decent plane crash survival story with nice characterizations and story line . it also has an awful lot of grammar and run on errors although . also at the end several pages are repeated which was irritating . i realize the some amount of money price was not very high but i have read a number of free or .99 cent kindle books with fewer problems . still i do not regret the purchase or time spent reading it because of the c-124 and description of where and how the actual crash took place . what i would like to see this author do is clean up and lengthen this book just a bit as it has so much to offer .,113,2

Kindle_Store,B006LAX8K2,"like a previous reviewer , i thought this was non fiction . it did not take long for that to be apparent . regardless of the grammatical errors , this might have been a good tale . however , it was written like a boy scout expedition . after burying the dead , the survivors carry on like a bunch of pals on a lengthy outdoor trip . no further concern of the dead , or mention of all families not knowing of their status . also , the notion that the us air force would give up a search after 30 days is pure nonsense . bottom line . a bit deceiving not knowing this is fiction up front , and a weak , weak story line . pollyannaish at best .",112,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"okay , i have to admit that i still have a soft spot for the first involved album mean , i could put watching cars go by on repeat for five hours straight and never once get tired of it . but i will also say that invol2ver is really growing on me as well . i found the ladytron track to be rather grating at first , but now it is one of my favorite tracks my top honors would probably go to 3 little piggy by the man himself . be sure to try it out with the headphones ; there has lots of little electronic nuances that get lost when you just try to listen to it in the car or on your computer . yet another genius album . i love sasha .",126,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"finally this is the sasha i have been looking for for a long , long time great album ! on par with digweeds transitions series !",23,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"invol2verwhat a unique blend of trance music . i happened to really like this ad . do sasha certainly uses his craft in the mixing of a interesting blend of ambient , machine , and human aspects into this music . the tracks flow quite nicely into each other , creating a nice even flow of anticipation , and excitement . none of the music presented here is practically hard hitting , but gives the listener more of a open spacey feel . there is certainly nothing is wrong with that ! i rate it four stars .",88,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"where can i begin ? wow . the first involved blew me away but this one came back and shredded me into pieces . the effects layed out over this ad are the trickiest i have ever heard and everything from the effects , the songs , the light use of the vocals , to the melodies works and blends perfectly well with each other . you can hear he has gotten to be the master of his equipment . everything is perfectly tight ! this ad has so much depth , your attachment to it grows more and more you listen . highly recommended , esp if you are into listening to music while in an altered state but not required . his other best works : xander ep , airdrawndagger , involved , new emissions of light and sound set . he is a genius .",128,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"loved it . if you are a fan of sasha , and know what he does with musicsome amountisten to it .",17,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"great music , right away it takes the attention away from your surroundings and makes you stay tuned through out the whole mix . sasha has proven himself once more with this great ad . really recommended !",34,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"just ordered it , and i have been listening to it quite a bit since it arrived . i especially like the track 3 little piggy . on my first listen , i thought disc one as a whole was decent , but had certain highlights . in listening to it again all the way through the next day , i like it even more . very immersive . once i am done with disc one , i am usually still wanting more . so it is nice that this is a two - ad set , and i can just roll into disc two without stopping !",88,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"here comes another great album by sasha . this one feels like a mix of foundation and involved . it has the distorted sound and the james - holden - like feeling from foundation and the amazing vocals like those in involved . the ad starts off strong with a nice vocal and beat , then it gets a little uneventful , then picks it up again with arcadia and continues on to destroy everything you touched which is the probably the best song on the ad , and finishes strong with a nice vocal . this album definitely stands out from the junks that most des put out these days . this album will be loved by those who enjoy foundation and or or involved . but is it better than the all time favorite and classic airdrawndagger ? no it is not .",127,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"sasha has never disappointed me in the past and here , he honors that legacy . you will be flown through incredible waves of mind - altering , ear - riveting rhythms . either on the road or with quality headphones , prepare to be naturally enthralled . buy this !",39,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"a true letdown from the original involved ! nothing jives in this new ad . do not get me wrong , sasha rocks , but there is much work to be done here . sorry ! the ladder part of the ad starts coming together and you start to feel . and then it ends making you want more . cheers !",52,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"a nice rebuttal to john digged and his transitions series . sasha weaves his signature atmospherics and mixing expertise into a collage of creative soundscapes amid driving beats . . his latest production exudes a more vocal touch than previous work but he strikes a nice balance while keeping things nice and taut . overall it is par for the course for sasha and his continued innovation keeps him one of the most interesting and relevant do or artist worldwide . . i put involved 2 next to airdrawndagger , in as far as creativity and conceptual production is concerned . his ibiza gu set is still his best but it was much less innovation as opposed to masterful track selection and mixing . . involved 2 keeps him moving forward and even those less enamored with his skill or creativity will be able to appreciate what he has accomplished with his current outing . he has still in the height of his powers here and the small pittance required to enjoy his current work is well worth it . a keeper .",160,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,i have been waitin for this ad for 4 years now and it was worth the wait . it starts off a lot like the first with the beat around 124bpm or so and picks up through the ad . this is every bit as good as the first and may be some what better . it is deep thick bass lines and moody melodies is what u would expect from sasha and the help from charlie may . if you i a fan of sasha or just good forward thinking progressive then you should pick this ad up right away .,95,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"not all tracks are keepers , but you should be able to get a full ad worth of awesome tracks if you burn what you like off ad 1 and 2 . great mixing of the tracks as few can do . one of the best cos out this year and best yet . it is tracks that you will only find on this ad against . hearing on other compilations . very original work . for perspective i also enjoy markus schultz , gabriel dresden , above beyond , cosmic gate , test , andrew bennett , sander van door , and more",89,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"great disc , a bit too reminiscent of gu13 and involved , but great stuff nonetheless ! gets played over and over and over !",21,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,i have always argued that sasha and john digged are the cream of the crop . and they usually are . but these other reviewers are crazy . this involved 2 was a letdown . it was just average . the first 2 tracks from involved 1 blow away this whole disc by themselves .,48,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"i have owned this album since it came out in 1991 . and i just recently re - discovered it the other day after finding it the other day under a bunch of car parts . one of the greatest things about this album is that it does not have a bad track . as someone else here has said , these songs will take you to another world . the faster songs will literally do so at the speed of light no pun intended . be careful here , as this ad certainly helped to place alot of my money in the hands of the california highway patrol back in the day . and even the slower songs are interesting and inspiring rather than dull and boring . now it might be nice if i could tell you something nice and wishy - washy about emotions conveyed in these songs . but as with any ad , this is a little above the head of a typical gearhead . even a new - wave loving gearhead such as myself are there any others on this planet ? . all i know is that this is one great ad that i was glad to find once again .",187,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"this ad is so amazingly gorgeous . every single song is beautiful and achingly dreamy in every possible way . old on this ad has a dreamy , innocent soundsome amounts of haunting instrumental , angelic female voices , mccluskey brit - boy voice all fuses together like a call from heaven . pure bliss , esp . the track was it something i said which is positively mandatory listening for tortured souls . pained and heartfelt , this ad hits you like no other old ad . it is more emotional than it is others , except maybe for liberator",85,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"yes that is right it is a masterpiece , and anyone who says something different does not like old or this type of music . andy is the reason old is so great . i saw the concert for this album and it was even better live . if you like this type of music then buy it you will not be disappointed , but you will not stop listening to it . look for a new ad from all of the original members old by the end of this year !",84,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"this albums sugar tax was done without the help of paul humphreys . andy mccluskey did it on his own and i have to say , it is fantastic . it is one of my favorite old albums of all times . pandora's box , speed of light , call my name , and sailing on the seven seas are breathe taking . the entire album is just awsome . andy did it and did it with a bang . no one thought that it was possible and that old was over after paul left the band . andy showed everyone that old lives on . i hope that one of these i hear that old is reformed and another great album would be on it is way . the last album universal was released in 1996 and it is a little hard to get in the us , but it is available as import .",137,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"when the two primaries of old split , most observers , myself included , expected the result to be disaster . it did not turn out that way . this is a strong album which harkens back to earlier old style while retaining elements of their mature sound . not the best old album , nothing like it , but strong electronic pop nonetheless . for children of the 60s and 70s , you owe it to yourself to get this album if only for the track apply xi . i have listened to this song more than 100 times , and it still gives me goose bumps every time i hear it .",99,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"others come close and sure i can probably agree that odds best song probably is not on this album . but , in terms of consistency and quality , this album is incredible . as an avid old music collector , i can attest that all old albums have fillers or other unappealing songs , but this has by far the least . this is a melodic , poetic , romantic , shake your hips , and mood making album . a must have . you will easily find several songs appealing , i guarantee it ! p.s. it is about the music , not how you naively think all artists should be stuck in their innovative or pioneering stage . no artist or band has ever done that , so grow up yourself !",113,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"this is one of the most beautiful albums i have bought in a long time . i admit i am a newly as far as old fans go , but i have long been into other awesome bands of the 80s such as new order and a - ha . this album certainly stands up to some of their best masterpieces . the first seven songs , especially , will take you away into another world entirely . some are fast - paced dance anthems and some are slower - paced ballads but they are all laced with a dreamy romantic aura . on the negative side i would have to say that apollo xi interrupts this flow and i do not feel it conforms well with the rest of the album . however , walk tall and neon nights offer more beauty afterwards . overall i think this ad is solid . i recommend this masterpiece to others who are only just not getting into old . more so than i do the singles .",151,13

Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"the very beginning was a little flowery in description which tempted me to quit right there . i read on in the sample and bought the book . this has fascinating characters , a wide range of kinds of people and creatures , and lots of action with a little mystery coupled with some romance . the ending is nicely done so that the tale is wrapped up but there is room for more books with the same characters . i will read any future books in this series .",83,0
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"i liked the premise of the book and the world it was set in . however , the main character , mistral , was very unlikeable . she was rash beyond reason , crazy moody and would have temper tantrums . she did not even care about the people who raised her . when she found out her adopted mother had died , even although her adoptive parents were really good to her , she did not care . then she met some guy and after several days , it seemed as if she became a totally different person although her brat - like qualities were still consistent . i read the whole book hoping my view of her would change because i liked some of the supporting characters and the plot ideas but when the book ended i knew i would not be reading the sequel . if minstrel had been tweaked in varying situations to make her more likeable and less volatile , i think i would have liked the book . yet , as it stands , i would not recommend it .",163,1
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"starts off great . crazy , brave , awesome woman warrior takes on monsters and evil and survives with the help of her warrior brothers . then she turns into a weak , sniveling , whiny baby when she . falls in love ? i find it unrealistic that such a tough and fearless girl could change so much . and even if she could , why does she let the guy dictate to her that she must persue the sight ? he keeps telling her to be who and what she wants , which is a warrior , not a seer , but she keeps giving in and let us everyone around her force her to be a seer . stupid and unbelievable at best",108,2
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"this book had an interesting story with a longer coming of age plot line than i expected , but still managed to pull it off . my only possible issues were with the main character who i had trouble relating to until a good way into the book , and speed with which the story developed . either way i would still recommend anyone in this genre to read it as the story ok and the price is not to bad either .",78,3
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"the problem is the main character and the emotional wreckage she is . way too much time spend on this and not enough on action . most characters are well done except the main . hunts are too short and lack punch , only to see the character fall back on her mental state as soon as possible",51,4
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"this is the first of four or more books . i enjoyed reading it , but could not get interested in the sequel although i tried several times . this rough and tumble gal becomes a love struck puppy at the end and never gets over it .",44,5
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"i had a hard time reading through the book due to the inconsistencies on mistral experience . on one hand we hear how she is such a great hunter and as any hunter knows is patience and that is one thing she does not seem to have . the book is peppered with a lot of whining and temper tantrums thrown in with how inexperienced she is in her role . if i did not know she was supposed to be older , i would assume she was all of 5 with how her character seemed to evolve . it does get a 3 although for the vivid descriptions of the surroundings . if a second book came out , i know i will not be buying it considering i have to keep skipping over so much of irritations in this book .",132,6
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"the first few paragraphs were hard to read due to punctuation errors , and i never complain about that ; but it sets the tone of the book . right after her adopted parents loving discussion about her future , said child is cold and unfeeling towards them . this theme is repeated , as the teenager refers to her home as a prison and never considers the love they gave her . as another reviewer said the heroine is a real turnoff . i also had problems with the collage dorm attitude that the training camp had . all party at the bar after working out all day , sophomore jealousy . i am barely into this book and just can not force myself to read more . the plot , if there is lonesome amounts in the endless descriptions of daily life . if author was trying to recreate a harry potter type of interesting school grounds , he or she failed big time . so tired of the teenager that can do it all . again , this was a kindle unlimited book and free , thank goodness !",171,7
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"i had enough after i read about half of the book . the story simply was not really interesting and neither were characters . in the end i just did not care what happens next . i personally felt reading any further would just be a waste of my free time . the characters do not seem to have any depth , and it is really hard to find the main character likable . she is stubborn and thoughtless , and quite often acts like a spoiled brat . she often gets angry when someone reasons with her , and actually does not seem to display any other emotions . until of course she gets in love . the love interest thread of the main character seems to me to have been just bluntly inserted like something off a checklist , and the relation further seems incredibly out of character , and incredibly unnatural . overall , i do not think will be waiting for any other works in this series .",151,8
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"can not wait for the next one . i love all the characters , exept maybe fabian . it is well written and awesome in all ways !",22,9
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"too simple characters with little development and a very vague world building . the main character is also social stupid if not all - around plain dumb , especially considering she can read and understand all feelings in others . it also feels off how the main character turns from unfeeling to obsessed in no time and with a deus ex machina reason .",58,10
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,interesting story that kept you wondering what would happen next . the overall sappy love drama was definately overplayed and quickly became boring .,22,11
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"could not connect with the characters , did not like the main character at all , she is rude , childish and self centered , prone to tantrums and anger displays , it was difficult to read about something you do not like , will not make the same mistake again . would not recommend .",43,12

Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"glad i bought the first book before seeing the negative comments . i have really enjoyed this series of books . i will grant that the main character is brash and offensive but that is the point . her name is mistral which essentially means a harsh wind . she is stormy , willful and undisciplined , entirely ruled by her emotions . the series is about her growth . i like the characters and appreciate the world ms. jones has created . fun experience . if it gives an idea of how much i have liked it , i got the fifth book thru kindleunlimited some amount of money a month for unlimited qualifying books but ended up buying it after i read it so i could add it to my permanent library .",118,14

Kindle_Store,B00LNM8X5S,i enjoyed reading this book . the author made it difficult to figure out who the murderer was until the end . lots of nuts and a lot of action .,28,6
Kindle_Store,B00LNM8X5S,"not very believable . . . take a little too much suspension of belief , but the characters are ok . the neurotic promiscuity of the heroin is getting a little old .",30,7
Kindle_Store,B00LNM8X5S,"this was a pretty good read , especially since i picked it up purely for the fact that it had to do with sharks and i have not read the other books in the series yet . the writing and characterizations are fairly simple , but not what i would call juvenile , so it makes it an easy read . the shark behavior in this book is fairly portrayed , which honestly surprised me because i have read shark books by so called shark experts that are full of inaccuracies or just plain silliness , so it was refreshing to see accurate portrayal , especially from someone not in the habit of writing shark books . one thing that did bug me although was some of the automatic assumptions of guilt based on the hobbies of certain people our fearless pis investigate . i am not going to say specifics because they would probably spoil the mystery , but i will say there is a difference between profiling and stereotyping , and this was clearly stereotyping likely based in ignorance . despite that , red surf was still a nice , easy read and i will likely end up reading the other books in the series .",189,8

Kindle_Store,B00LNM8X5S,"unbelievable bad . people getting eaten by sharks , but do they close down the beach ? of course not . leah is a petulant , do nothing person up to the very end . addicted to every guy that looks at her . how did these books become popular ? truly a book for the brain dead chick",51,11

Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,this title is very deceiving . you have to read through the first 1/3 of the book before the author tells you he is all about juicing . i have probably tried every other diet but i am definitely not into juicing .,40,2
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"this book starts out pretty raw and honest . and from there gives the down and dirty details as to why we are overweight and unhealthy . most of us live our lives on the crap diet : caffeine , refined sugars , alcohol and processed foods . from there , the author introduces better choices in food , mindset and action to turn your health around . i found a lot of useful information i will be applying .",69,3
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"easy reading would have liked more how to detail did enjoy reading the book . concept of program was good , should not be difficult",23,4
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"this book tackles healthy living and weight loss from different dimensions such as the emotional and mindset angles that i have not come across very often , as well as the more common aspects of weight loss , making it a well rounded book . it also covers issues such as easy ways of monitoring our food intake portion control with the aim of adjusting our food intake to what has been scientifically proven to be healthy . however , i am especially pleased with the chapters on water chapter 6 and exercise sessions set out in chapter 20 . i have gained a whole lot more from reading these two chapters than i have found anywhere else . the ideas contained in them are very easy to understand and implement and where there could be a challenge in taking action , the authors have offered tips for overcoming some of the common challenges . overall , i feel the book is very well written and contains a wealth of information that i will be looking to incorporate into my existing health and weight loss schedule . many thanks to the authors for such a great and beneficial book .",187,5
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"i liked the look of this book as it was aimed at women . on reading it i find that the information within the book is just as important for men . not only are the most common issues faced with being overweight covered but things that i would never have associated with being overweight . there is everything i could think of do do with eating and weight control covered within these pages . the recommended plans are cost effective and do not call for expensive foods or supplements that so many other books on this subject cover . everything is covered in an easy to follow and understand way that anyone could follow with no problems at all . i love the way the authors stress that this is not a diet book and that eating is good and not bad for us . as i said earlier everything covered is inexpensive to do , which is what has prevented me following methods in other books . after reading this book it is an interesting read just as a book . this could be a layman's text book on nutrition . getting to 150 must be possible with this book and i will be healthy doing it .",198,6
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"this book explains healthy eating very well . if you follow the suggestions detailed in the book , you will be healthy . the weight loss is a side effect . that is a very welcome side effect , but longer healthy life is even more important . i do not usually worry about toxins in my food , but after reading this book , i will be very aware of them . if that is all you get out of this book , you have learned a lesson that needs learning . the 7 minute workout is a perfect plus . even i can do this program . i look forward to testing out the program and the exercise program . buy this book !",110,7
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"it is that time of year when a lot of people start formulating their new years resolutions . usually losing weight makes that list for a lot of people every year . well , they should put reading this book at the top of their list . it is a very well researched and well written approach to losing weight , exercising and eating right . there are so many myths floating around that tout this diet and that diet , it is ok to eat this and not that , and on and on so that it is very confusing . well this book clears up a lot of those myths . the author clearly knows his subject matter and presents it in an easy to understand manner . my point is that this book , while it outlines a weight loss program , i would call if more of a save your life program . great information and highly recommended .",146,8
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"this book was a breath of fresh air . many diets on the market are simply not healthy and will have you losing and gaining weight like a yo - yo . this diet is different , the all natural approach gets your body functioning like it is supposed to so that you can live a healthy lifestyle and lose weight naturally . not only do they go into detail about what you need to do to lose the weight , they also tell you why the steps you are taking help you lose weight . by reading this book you learn more about your body and how it breaks down or does not break down food and minerals . this is vital to losing weight , if you do not know how your body functions , then you can not lose weight in a healthy and effective way . sure you can crash diet and lose weight , but you will still be fatigued and be left feeling unsatisfied . with this diet , not only will you be losing weight but you will have more energy and will not be left feeling hungry and unsatisfied . so , if you are looking for a natural way to lose weight and live a healthy life style this is the book for you .",197,9
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"i really enjoyed reading this book . i thought it would be another one of those fad diet books full of fluff , short on substance and low on useful information . but this one is a keeper . it lays out why you really gain weight and how to lose pounds and inches permanently without starving yourself . anyone who wants to lose weight should make this book part of their reference library . it will make a great gift for anyone who is serious about losing weight .",83,10
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,lots of great tips . easy to follow . easy reading and easy to understand . would read more by this author and subject .,21,11
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"i liked the non - diet approach in this kindle book . we know that melting fat with the latest diet fad just fails . while this book had the normal advice of such things as drink more water and have an accountability partner , i was especially interested in the idea about using salt in an interesting way and the comments about our exhaust system . this really had some new insights and makes me think more about taking single steps to losing weight rather than trying to force things to move too quickly . this is a smart book for women and i am glad to have ordered it",104,12
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"when the author keeps repeating he is not a doctor , take heed . sounded like they are trying to kill you with salt in the first page and then start talking about selling you things , but you have to contact them to get info . not a smart way to lose weight at all . never finished reading it .",55,13
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"i think the aspect i liked the most about this book are the strategies to avoid having to exercise willpower . let us face it i lack of willpower is the single factor most likely to put a stop to any good intentions about weight loss . it is oh so hard to resist that extra portion , or most often in my case , chocolate . the authors also provide some great information about what constitutes healthy eating i what you should be eating , as well as what to avoid . anyone who follows the advice offered in this book should not only she had a few pounds , but they will end up healthier , which means they will feel good , and when we feel good , we look good .",119,14

Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"complimentary copy provided by author or publisher for an honest review i read this book not really knowing what it was about . well i have to say it was definitely worth the surprise . it was fun reading a book that i knew nothing about . this book was filled with fun , suspense , action and a bit of romance . it was nice to read something although that was not a sex fest . this book was definitely a young adult paranormal book in my opinion . the only thing i did not like about this book , well 2 things really , was the main girl character . she is a bit wimpy in my opinion . i like a good strong lead female character and while this girl was strong in some ways , she was weak in many others . it did not take away from the book although . it just made you want to learn more about the others . the other thing i did not like was that it ended . i truly wish there was more to the book . i was definitely not ready for it to end and can not wait for the next in the series . lizzy ford has definitely done it again with yet another great series !",200,0

Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"i received this arc in exchange for a fair and honest review . i will admit i had a hard time warming up to this one , but by the fourth chapter , i was interested to see where the story would go . the book was character driven , although , it did not have too much character development a fine job of using the tarot reading to clue the readers on the protagonists objectives well done ! . i do not read a lot of too doo books , but i found the storyline interesting , and the mystery pulled me right in . a bit drawn out in some places , so i rolled my eyes over some of the redundancy , but overall , a great plot . open ended , so i assume this is the first part of a series , but i was satisfied with the book .",135,4
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,i really enjoyed this story . i found the story line so appealing . the characters draw you in and have you hooked from the start . can not wait for the next book .,31,5
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,it is a different story than i usually like but since i love lizzy fords other books i had to check it out . the writing style is a little different than lizzy usual style . i found that i could not put it down .,41,6
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,i read this and i thought it was pretty good . it makes me want to read the book 2 already to keep the story going . i love how the characters all tie together and how the mystery unfolds .,38,7
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"i do not usually read much to do with voodoo but i love lizzy fords books so there was no way i was missing out on this one for that tiny reason . unsurprisingly it was just as great as all of her other books but completely different at the same time . even if you somewhat hesitant because of the subject you should still give this a chance , lizzy is an amazing author and this just goes to prove it . i will definitely be on the look out for the next book in this series .",93,8

Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,at first just reading the description i thought it would be good but a little bland . i was pleasantly surprised that i could not put this book down . i am anxious for the second book in this series to come out .,41,10
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"new orleans and voodoo what more could you need , add a little love and you have an amazing story by lizzy ford . i liked the point of view from different characters because it is nice to know what else is going on with different characters to understand more of the story . renee is my favorite character strong , smart and loyal it will be interesting to see how he helps addy with breaking the curse that jayden and adds family started . i enjoyed reading cursed and can not wait to see what happens next hopefully we will not have to wait long for the next installment . cursed has been moved to my favorite book that lizzy was written .",114,11
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,i read this book as a arc i really liked the book before and i was wondering if she could change it too make it better and lizzy ford did . i think the book is really great and it flows a lot better . it is about a girl name adrienne it croix and how she is trying to find out what happend to her missing sister . she then finds out that her sister is not what she appears to be and may not be as innocent as she wants to believe she is . then there is rene who cares for his brother jax but is concerned that he may be into dark magic that is way above his head . then there is the curse . i am eagerly waiting for the next book .,132,12
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"i loved this book , at first it took me a little while to get used to the talking since they are from the south . but after a little while it just added to it . i am torn between being glad i read it and being upset . i want to know what happens , but i read it right away and now i have to wait . i absolutely love how her books flow , and this one did not disappoint !",75,13
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"i read the original version of the book and let me tell you , this re - written or edited version is a lot better . the history of the curse and how the voodoo families are connected are laid out in a much better way than the original . it has good flow , the characters are more relatable , and the ending was setup much better for the next book . i can not even imagine what it would be like for the main characters not the child of a politician or a tarot - reading follower of voodoo , but ford develops the characters in a way that makes you live the story with them anyway . you feel bad for jayden when he feels that he can not do what he wants to do because of this familys political connections . you fear for adrienne when she realizes that she is connected to this voodoo curse more intimately than she first realizes . you even feel for rene when he gets stuck in the middle of this centuries old curse by forces outside of his control . i enjoyed this book and can not wait to read what is next for these characters .",189,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BLH,"ginuwines first album from 1996 was so hot and sexy ! it had the music , beats and grooves for it . pony was funky , but there was a funkiest in the ballads of tell me do u want to , that phone song , lonely daze , and the breezy only when ur lonely . this was one of timberlands first successful albums along with missy elliott and aaliyahs , as his complicated beats dominate this album . holler must have been done in one take , because the music is all on point ! i still play that a lot , because that bass kicks [ . ] on it ! i liked ginuwines ultra funky remake of princes when doves cry . now , when you are remaking a prince song , you have got ta do it right , and this version kicks some serious [ . ] genuine recalls the carnal mentality of princes first few albums in the 80s . this album broke genuine in a big way . i saw him in concert in 2000 and he really tore it up on the stage ! great dancers as well as strong vocals from i himself ! he has really accomplished a lot in 4 albums , having hits from every one and each one selling very well . i hope he continues to surprise us with more exciting music !",205,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"i have been a it fan for some years now having downloaded or purchased most of their albums as well as their live concerts . their work has always held inspiration . the thing about taking things to the edge is that you do not always hit what is popular and trendy . it seems to me that these guys have been marginal but their musical experimentations are starting to pay off with stuff that as one reviewer put it , that when you listen to it , you need someone to peel you off the wall . it is simply winsome amountorgeous , dynamic , interesting , moving , and at times incredibly inspired . the title track , dreadwing , knocked me on my glutes . i simply did not expect it given the rather quiet opening . arriving somewhere is complex and beautiful . i do not know . i read these reviews sometimes and reviewers can be all over the map . but the reviews here all seem to give pretty high marks ! . if you like to rock , and you have never heard it before , just do it !",168,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,as good as they say if your into the tree !,10,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"i can not stop listening to this ad . i recommend buying it . i payed some amount of money for dreadwing at the concert , i wish i had bought it at amazon . i had known about it for about a year i saw they were coming to illinois , well i saw porcupine tree live at the park west on may 28th in chicago it was really cool to say the least . at times i am reminded of other progrock bands . i love that they have mixed heavy modern riffs with beautiful clean acoustic melodies within the same song . i am not a reviewer , really just a fan musician . i have listened to this ad 3 or 4 times everyday since the concert loved every minute . i recently purchased in absentia signify am looking forward to giving them a listen . even if you are not a progrock fan you will like this band .",150,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"yet once again this band has dazzled me with their brilliance ! i am glad i waited a while to review this , because at first i did not think i liked it as well as in absentia . but it did not take long for all these numbers to get their hooks in me . i love the way steven wilson bares his soul on the songs he writes , something that is almost none existent in this modern - day , mass manufactured songwriting world . it is like an invitation into his private experiences and i , for one , am glad i accepted . it is easy to see that steven is an eclectic music fan . i hear so many different influences here : led zip , king crimson which is further enhanced by a guest appearance by adrian blew , radiohead , et all . but the thing i like with this recording is that it is another evolutional step from the last , and that is what i define as progressive . there are moments of their floyd era period interspersed with high voltage rock which really works for me . it is hard to understand how songs with mainly melancholic lyrics can always seem to lift my spirits . am i growing stranger by the minute ? this is a must have !",200,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"i was in high school when led zeppelin , pink floyd , yes , and more were in their prime i am just over 50 . this group ranks right up there as musicians and with their vision of what a complete album should be like . it took a couple listens to fully enjoy this epic ad . now i can not get it out of my ad player . it gives hope for new rock music , they are superb ! check out their album in absentia it is just as good , slightly less hard . someone told me that classic rock magazine named dreadwing the best new ad in 2005 . not sure if that is true , but they get my vote ! play the songarriving somewhere but not herea few timeslot ! you will get hooked !",127,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"everyone should know the great music this band has made . unfortunately , american radio plays crap and they play it over and over and over . it is too bad corporations control every aspect of our lives , what we see , what we hear , what we read , and more do yourself a favor and go outside the box a little and find some magicsome amounting porcupine tree .",61,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"i have most of the it albums now finally , also some of steve wilsons backfield and no - man work . music preferences are subjective to the individual , but there are common threads . i have a sizeable collection spanning everything from ace of base to zero 7 . i have most of pink floods work , roger waters and david gilmore work , as well as dream theater and queensryche , and more i know you do not really care about what i collect , but i wanted to share a reference point . when i listen to rock which is more often than not , i try to listed to the aforementioned artists and groups . pink floyd , especially will always be my favorite head music . its dreadwing plants itself very well in the rock part of my collection . the music is layered , complex and very well written . the title track , dreadwing , is an instant hit . while the 3rd track , lazarus , demonstrates steve wilsons vocals and the groups ability to produce a beautiful melody . arriving somewhere but not here , is the jewel of the album . this entire 12 minute track may very well intoxicate you . the simple guitar repetition , vocals and acoustics are the best i have heard in years . enjoy !",198,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"this recording is definately the most advanced recording of anything available on the planet at this time . porcupine tree has even moved a step ahead of king crimson i a remarkable feat in itself with this recording . after listening to this i can really understand how fitting it is to have robert tripp opening some of the shows for the band on this tour . i agree that steve wilson has become a musical genius as tripp is as he is making the most advanced , wellwritten , original work of any artist out there . this ad has incredible depth , beauty , and insight into the times we live inand it rocks hard ! also check out backfield , hopeth , and no - man all with steve wilson . porcupine tree have risen above the flower kings , socks beard , dream theater and all of the other new progressive rock bands of the new century ! i truly believe that this ad will be a classic for years to come . this one is going to be hard to top and anyone who does not have this in their collection does not know music . period . a billion star rating !",191,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"why are not these guys on the radio ? well , i am doing my part . this past christmas all my presents included either in absentia or dreadwing . the selection as to who got which album was purely random simply because both albums are superb . everyone , absolutely everyone who got this a part of their gift loved it and bought the counterpart . quite possibly some of the finest mixed and mastered material ever available makes it an even better treat . wilson is some kind of genius with his use of light versus dark . and now with the release of blank planet this completes just an amazing trilogy of albums that are constantly playing back - to - back - to - back in my car , home stereo , and computer .",117,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"at the risk of spouting nothing but hyperbole , i can honestly say that this album is flawless . a masterpiece . the best ad of 2005 . one of the best ever . yes , it really is that good . with dreadwing , porcupine tree managed to combine their newer slightly metallic sound with their pop sensibilities and their lush atmospheric side , ala their earlier material like up the downstair and signify . as always , the production is tremendous . every instrument is very clear and there is a perfect amount of separation so the music has plenty of room to breathe and draw the listener in . i do not think i have ever heard a better drum sound that the one producer or songwriter or guitarist or vocalist or musical extraordinaire steven wilson achieved on the song halo . this is , in my estimation , the fourth consecutive five star - album porcupine tree has released and they are showing no signs of letting up . one would think that after gems like stupid dream , lightbulb sun and in absentia , they would be running out of ideas , but they managed to top themselves once again .",173,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,difficult to equal the brilliance of in absentia . but steve wilson is brilliant and did just that ! amazingly awesome prog rock .,21,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"i heard about it from a co - worker and at the time did not pay close enough attention . it was several years later i remembered that strange band name and checked out a few of the bands tracks . wow , i wish i paid attention sooner . like other reviewers i started to buy up the entire catalog . most people just have not heard of it because of the poor selection of music played by radio stations but the word of mouth is growing . the band has not had an album for several years now but i suspect their next release if or when that ever occurs would be a huge hit in the us . dreadwing is a great example of the bands talent . every player is well represented on their albums . the drums , the bass , the keyboards . i know it is obvious to mention steve wilson but his band mates are just as incredible . i think that is why so many like to hear mr. wilson with it . if you are on the fence about this band check out mellotron scratch and if not sure if they rock out enough for you check out anethsitize from fear of the black planet . spread the word !",198,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000B9EYK2,"this is a wonderful did with many upbeat songs . the blend of the accordion with the guitars and drums make a nice sound . of course , freddy fender sings a couple of his big hits ! very entertaining group !",37,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000B9EYK2,"this is an outstanding did . these guys were so good and they were having so much fun during this performance . i really did not realize that freddie fender was such a competent guitarist . why did not i know that ? doug sam and augie meyers were at the top of their game here they were always at the top of their game and i suppose augie still is . flaco is the greatest . all the other musicians that played on this were fabulous . derek o'brien even shows up for a couple of songs . i wish more stuff on did by doug sam would come out . he was such a supercool kat . doug seemed irritated at a couple of things going on behind the stage during parts of the show some screw ups going on back there , which seems rare enough for austin city limits but other than that , sam was just really kicking it out during this show . a few times he really opens up on the guitar and even went out in the dancing audience while jamming out bigtime .",176,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000B9EYK2,"what an enjoyable did ! the group is in fine form in another wonderful austin city limits production . it is a shame such a talented artist as doug sam passed away suddenly at 58 years of age sam died november 18th , 1999 . the song list is outstanding in this october 16th , 1990 show . i am a big fan of the individual members past hit standards that is : she has about a mover , medicine , before the next tear drop falls but found myself truly enjoying dinero , hey baby que paso and the rockin adios amigos . if this genre of music is what you enjoy then you will not be disappointed . i was not a fan of this style till i discovered these guys years ago . picture quality : 5 stars audio quality : 5 stars no bonus features p.s . rolling stone magazine reviewed and rated this did a 4 out of 5 star in december 2005 one short of a classic .",154,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000B9EYK2,"i will not repeat what all of the previous reviewers have stated so well . i received my did today and watched it with my dad this evening . he loved it . now understand that i am 65 and an old rock i roll guy , and that my dad is 92 . just goes to show that great music is cross - generational . and although the performance on this disc is almost twenty years old , it is strong and fresh and will survive long past most contemporary flavor of the week stuff . thank you for your outstanding musicianship , doug and freddie , you will always be remembered . a pity that there were so few albums created .",107,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"this century answer to pubs performance is one of the most dazzling , joyous concerts i have ever seen . this did does an excellent job of capturing the feeling of the live show , which is packed with visual surprises , boundless energy , and some really surprising song choices . the audio ad is just icing on a magnificent cake . the bonuses are great , too , including three music videos , two bonus numbers from the london performance it does not often snow at christmas and my girl , and the epic medley brit awards performance with lady gaga and brandon flowers .",93,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"i have seen pub live several times , and pandemonium is a treat for all fans . continuing the cube motif from cubism , the boys put on a great show . the big hits are all here , some in new versions . the real treat are the never before performed songs like two divided by zero and why do not we live together . the did brings back all the memories of seeing the live . also , the bonus footage is great with the christmas encores . alot of fun !",81,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"this is a nice little surprise ! fans will enjoy all of it , the rest will enjoy most of it ! the boys like to throw out surprise selections in their shows , and they did a couple here too . in all fairness , neils voice may not sound studio perfect , but live performances are very hard to do flawlessly without using loud background singers or echo effects to compensate live performance difficulties . they have used little of that here , and neil has essentially laid his sweet little voice out naked for us on this effort . i think it is absolutely fabulous !",96,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"the video and audio in this did is excellent , it exceeded my expectations . the dynamics and detail are superb , video is clear free of artifacts . the concerts music is very nice all songs are top notch , and you do get extra taste of the pet shop boys ability to improve any song they get . the only negative is the did box itself , is not good quality is flimsy ease to break . comes boxed like a ad .",76,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"nice to have two diskette , one for music only ; the other for the actual london 2009 show and music . i believe the next release entitled eclipse from the pet shop boys is due out in july 2013 .",37,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"the attention to detail in this tour was second to none . very tight with many surprises ! alas , neils voice may now be lacking the range he enjoyed as recent as the cubism tour which i saw and enjoyed . i got the import version and it only plays on one of the did players i own . region 0 . highly recommend !",59,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"the pat shop boys are indeed back . as a diehard fan of the boys i was pleased by this ad or did combo . the concert was awsome . just that they did not do 2 - 3 songs that would have made it complete , but then again their catalog is huge so i can forgive them for leaving out some their their hits . just wish the boys had more hits over here in the states than they have .",71,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,this is a must for pub fans . i attended this concert in chicago and it was awesome . to be able to watch and listen to it on ad and did and have the extras was a no question purchase .,39,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"the best thing to come out of the 80s. i own nearly all of their stuff . not the christmas albums . i am still a fan of bing crosby ! neil tenant and chris lowe have proven to be the pop fave for decades . their continual success and longevity speaks for itself . if you have not heard their latest stuff , pandemonium is a great start . the c.d. sounds great , the d.v.d. in eluded also impressive . with remarkable success here in the states ; pubs records sales are just barely , below by the numbers : madonna , donna summer , janet jackson , then pub ! you just can not ignore their raw - talent !",101,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"this new live concert pandemonium is a strong come back for the pet shop boys . their best live concert performances since 1994 when they did the discovery tour . brilliantsome amountively , and they brought back some old songs that although not well known , nor commercial , are seminal in their discography , do i have to ? , kings cross , two divided by zero , all from the early days , are brilliant masterpieces that only hard core fans will recognize . very glad to see that they skipped songs from their dark ages , from the 2002 release that made me believe that the pet shop boys were on the path to oblivion with that awful recording . back with full force and an amazing audiovisual show which is their trademark . this is a concert ad that you should definitely add to your collection if you do not have any live performance ad and did yet , if you already have the others , concrete , live at savoy , and more this one will surprise you . this is an instant classic , and a demonstration of why they were awarded the brit awards to their contribution in music over the last 25 years .",188,13

Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,i loved this story . once i started reading i could not put it down . the story brought many memories of my interracial dating and later marriage . loved it !,27,0
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,this book was written poorly with bad grammar and misspellings that took away from the story . authors need to proof their work and ask themselves if it makes sense before publishing . i will not read this author again and am removing it from my kindle .,44,1
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,i like this book . the male protagonist was a man who knew what he wanted and knew how to get it . i like how it was not those cliche alphas that mostly cared about himself . drakes emotion felt genuine . rachel was a decent heroine but i just felt like drake dominated the novel . it was a quick romance . wish it was longer but it was good .,65,2
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,loved it ! could not put out down . the story was that of an interracial couple that was told beautifully . pleased with the entire book .,24,3

Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,i read this book in 2days only because i had to work . but i could not put it down until finished . i thought the characters were very likeable and story line was good . loved the interracial thing .,37,8
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,"this was the first i or i novel by sam crescent . it was an ok read ! i did felt the two main characters rachel and drake were missing something and i could not connect with the characters . i felt rachel was younger than her twenties , and not over 21 . drake was an alpha male , and knew he wanted rachel as his wife , when he first saw her . i can not really say i enjoyed the book as much as her other books , but i give her credit for trying a new genre .",88,9
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,"i thoroughly enjoyed reading this book . the main characters , drake and rachel , are two people who are perfect for each other . you have drake , the alpha guy what wants the sweet rachel as his woman and will stop at nothing to get her . then you have the virgin rachel , who is trying to rebuild herself after a bad breakup in the city . together , they show a sweeter side of a love that is worth fighting for . also , because this is a book by sam crescent , it is very very hot ! enjoy !",91,10
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,well done . i enjoy reading this book . i hope i can read a second one,17,11
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,"i loved reading the love story of drake and rachael . drake was a man with a plan . he claimed rachael as his woman and damned any man or anyone to keep him from his woman . rachael was hurt in the past by her ex - boyfriend and did not want to trust her feelings towards drake , who she thought was nothing more than a womanizer . once she let her walls down and saw drake as the man he really was they fell in love in built a life together . drake gave rachael the moon sun and stars . i really enjoyed this book .",100,12
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,overall a good story however i felt that the book lost some of it is charm with the bad language and the very romance words during their love sence . i enjoyed reading about strong women and men and great passion sexual action . the love sence were more like sex without any emotional connection .,52,13

Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,an amazing book . rarely does an author have the ability to describe dark and evil times in such a beautiful and mesmerizing way .,23,2
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"this beautiful and poetic story is one of the best novels i have read in a long time . since the book was originally written in arabic it does not read as an iraqi author writing for foreigners , and this makes the story seem more intimate and real . sian anton eloquently portrays the immense tragedies that iraqis have faced over the years through an individual story about a failed artist , and while the story conveys a deep sadness , it is also multidimensional and will leave you thinking about many different ideas or images or stories . readers who have some understanding of iraq history might appreciate the book more , but i think it should seem accessible for anyone . i read it right after fiasco : the american military adventure in iraq , which is a powerful combination or sequence if your aim is to read more about iraq generally . i do wish that the publisher had allowed sian anton to keep the original arabic title , the pomegranate alone , but other than that , this book is near perfect .",165,3
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"beautiful , poignant tale of the life of corpse washer from the iran iraq war to the aftermath of the disastrous american invasion . you do not have to be iraqi to appreciate awards struggle to survive each day .",36,4
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"i read this book in my islamic civilizations class at mu and i absolutely fell in love with this book . it can be a dark book at times and very descriptive , but sian has such a powerful imagination that he makes every chapter vivid and puts pictures into your mind . i also had the chance to skype with the author sian anton , asking him all kinds of questions about his book . this book will not disappoint , i guarantee . the main character helps you understand what it is like to be surrounded by death in a militarized and civil war area . this book is fantastic .",104,5
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,book arrived on time and it looks great,9,6
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,not only it has historical importance but accomplishes a great deal of sensibility . highly recommended as one of the deceive pieces of contemporary literature,24,7
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"i think this book offered great insight and humanity to those of us in thus who have witnessed the fall of madam hussein and it is effect on the iraqi people from the outside looking in . life takes it is toll , one can not overcome anything .",43,8
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,i absolutely loved this novel . i read it about 3 times for the same class . we discussed trauma and oppression and this was one of the books on our list that semester and i completely devoured it in one sitting . needless to say it was what i used to write all my reports on and it continues to be one of the best books i have read in quite a while . anton uses beautiful metaphors to bring us into the world of jawed and his family . to think that anton spent 4 years total between writing and then translating in the world of jawed is amazing to me . he did an amazing job of capturing this snapshot of time .,118,9
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"today is the anniversary of the al queda attacks . almost 3,000 killed and many first respondents suffering and or dead . this short poetic novel brings the late 20th century history of iraq alive through the life of the corpse washer : the war with iran , karate , our 1st invasion , and the last . the divisions between the iraqis that our bungled occupation forced to flare is in front of our eyes . now we are again in iraq . there is no answer in this novel .",82,10
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"the corpse washer , this novel of sian anton that it is translated from it is arabic version titled the pomegranate alone by him too to english , and as i read it couple of times and now having it in english , the same feelings that struck my high walls of isolation and demolished them to appear naked as the reality is naked , bitter and painful ! reading and absorbing the main character in this novel jawed or jodi let me think , and to believing this story is not fiction , i felt winsome amounted his questions , transformed myself to this character , and after i finished the reading , i was naked again , felt of huge emptiness , indeed i just want to go back between the words to find myself , yes it is sorrow , fear , and pain but whenever i read any chapter , i feel i am standing next to jodi , as his close friend that he will never die and will never leave him alone ! this novel , the corpse washer is a must to read , if you want to see iraq and get the picture from another corner , this novel will help you , and it is highly recommended !",193,11
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"i recently read this book wondering if it would be appropriate for my ninth grade students , and while i would not choose it for them , i loved the book myself . i found it engaging throughout the entire read . it grabbed my attention right from the beginning and did not let go . it provides a realistic portrayal of life in iraq during this time period . one thing about the corpse washer i came to enjoy was how the main narrative is interrupted with brief memories or vignettes from the past . to me it gave the book a true sense of realism . i can only imagine that iraqis trying to survive this time period spent quite a lot of time reflecting on the past . the vignettes gave the book a disorienting feeling , which again must have been the way that many iraqis felt . i highly recommend this book , in fact i have already purchased another book by sian anton , jam : an iraqi rhapsody , and i can not wait to start it",166,12
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,interesting characters and story of iraqi life during the dysphoria . beautiful writing comes across in this translation of literary work by the author .,23,13
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"this book was originally written in arabic , but then translated by the author , into english . according to members of our book group who speak both languages , the content was slightly adjusted to accommodate the different audience . most of my book group enjoyed this more than i did , but then , one of my pet hates is recollection of dreams in novels , and there is a lot of that here . my other quibble was that i found the narrative a bit stilted in places . on the plus side , this book provides an insiders view into life in iraq from the relative peace of the 1960s until current times . jawed is attending university in the late 1980s , training to become an artist , against his fathers wishes . he has considerable talent , but has to abandon his dreams when he needs to take over his fathers business , washing the dead of the sunni religion . as the iraqi wars intensify and the bodies start building up he becomes more and more depressed by his situation . this is not a cheerful novel , but it is an excellent insight into life in iraq and is a easier to read than a lot of arabic novels in translation .",199,14

Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,i am loving this series and ready to burn delivers all the sass and sizzle and humour of the first two books . plenty of laugh - out - loud moments and a few tear - jerking ones too . is alvarez has crafted a cast of characters you can not help falling in love with and will want to revisit with each new book . and the christmas novella christmas with you is a great follow - up read . i can not wait for book number five !,74,1
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"another great story by tracey alvarez . my favorite part about these books is the character development , especially of the hero . at the beginning , i was not fond of del westlake , and i wondered how the author is going to turn him around . by about halfway , i am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt , by the end , i would marry him . del westlake has a lot on his plate pun intended and he has to learn to accept help before he can truly be worthy of our heroine . a wonderful read although if i am honest , it could do with a few less swearwords . purchased on amazon canada , reviewed here for greater exposure .",111,2

Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,i had to love this witty romance because the characters were so real . lots of snarky wit and arrogance covering self confidence issues as they both try not to give in to the attraction . i received the book free in return for an honest review .,45,8
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"tracey alvarez managed to take me to stewart island once again . i loved the banter and friction between the two main characters . as with the first two , this book is filled with plenty of hilarious one liners that had me chuckling well into the night . well done tracey .",48,9
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"this is book three in the due south series and each one is a great story in itself but also builds on the previous books . the women are strong , the men are gorgeous and the story lines are sexy . i highly recommend them . makes me want to move to new zealand !",51,10
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"i love how traces couples all have unique relationships . they are all quite real in their flaws and quirks and issues . family and trust and forgiveness were primary elements in this story , as they were in her first 2 . the chemistry between them was hot but they had a cute playful side too that i liked a lot . and i felt like i could relate to share a bit more than to piper or media but , while he was a good match for share , i was not as keen on del as i was on west and ben . but i will definitely be going on to book 4 ! i want to live in ban !",113,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"while not one of my favorite miles lips , his adaptation of porgy and bess nevertheless is soulful , and offers the listeners a different look at miles the man who respects the classics and does them justice . this up only encapsulates a very small fraction of what miles davis was , but still , it is a very important ad , showing miles , while certainly restrained in his playing , comfortable in a big band setting , and blowing . great ad .",75,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"the is the first miles davis recording i owned . since then i have become a great appreciator of the works he has compiled . listening to porgy bess is almost like listening to the score of a film . each track projects to your minds eye the story behind each song . for example , the song i love you porgy paints vividly the cries of a woman being unwillingly torn from her lover . the prayer shows the struggle of a person trying desperately to persevere through adversity . the albums highlight and one of the all - time favorite miles davis cuts , summertime ignites your soul as soon as that first note cuts through your speakers . the album as a whole focuses more on the orchestra element than the jazz that is miles trumpet element . the album is without a centerpiece for a miles davis collection .",138,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,if you are a miles davis fan then this album is a must have as it is a classic example of his work .,23,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"look closely to see what is being written about miles davis porgy bess , and see how sometimes words fail us all . you will find words like : must - have , best superb and the like . but they simply can not do justice to this fabulous piece of music . this may be the best collaboration of davis and gil evans . when you add the gifts that they have shown on their other work to a combination with the brothers gershwin , you understandably come up with something splendid , notwithstanding the fact that gershwin and davis could not have been different sociologically as they could have been . the melodies here are comfortably familiar to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of american music , because they have been done so often by such a diverse group of performers . however , the minimalist playing of miles davis , combined with the musical tapestry created by evans makes this wonderful music new again . hearing the trumpet of miles davis in the familiar strains of summertime would make both louis armstrong and even gabriel put down their horns and say wow . no music collection can be considered complete without this epic .",190,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"beautiful rendition of porgy bess . i was disappointed that the lyrics were not part of the program , but the music is so fantastic that it is fine as is .",29,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"i write this review as a confessed jazz amateur . that said , this is some of the most beautiful music i am aware of . miles davis employs a sensitivity and subtly that defy description . i would not be the first of his fans to be awed by his almost pervasive minimalism , but i am constantly chilled in a most positive way by the startling sound that appears from the black silence he paints . samuel beckett once wrote that . every word is a stain on silence and nothingness . certainly davis has taken this thought to heart . like a negative contour sketch that highlights the empty space , davis dances around the silence , telling only enough of a musical story to leave you begging for more . whether or not porgy and bess , sounds as gershwin intended is largely irrelevant , because it sounds very much as davis intended , and that makes this a fabulous recording .",151,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,this is the best jazz recording of this opera and is probably miles davis at his best .,17,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"i adore miles davis and also gil evans . they have played together very successfully , and the works featuring them together have become classics . however , i was disappointed with this ad . to play on miles kind of blue , i would like to say that this album is way too blue . it is too slow , too dreamy , very rambling , and sometimes only the ghost of the melody can be heard . it put me to sleep . i was highly disappointed ,",77,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,brilliant album and sound by miles davis . a must addition to my collection . i love it !,16,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"for my taste , as a fairly casual jazz fan and as someone who prefers the pre - fusion career of mr. davis , say , before 1965 or so , porgy and bess is a winner . not as unbelievably somber as sketches of spain but more consistent in emotion than miles ahead his other two large - band collaborations with arranger gil evans . i am not crazy about porgy as a work of art in it is original form , finding it brilliant only in parts . what miles and gil have tweaked in the score to fit their improvisational impulses and yet be faithful to the composers intentions works quite well . this ad version clocks in at just under one hour , and every track is worth a close listen or two i find earphones help before one puts it on the changer as background to driving or household tasks . read six or ten of the earlier reviews to get better data than i can give as to the musicianship . i judge by the standard did i enjoy hearing it ? will i look forward to the next time i get to play it ? do i think it was worth the price i paid ? the answers to all three are yes , yeah , and of course .",204,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"if you can not have a jazz collection without kind of blue , then you certainly can not have a miles davis collection without porgy and bess . this is the best arrangement of porgy and bess tunes from the original by my favorite composer gershwin , and it is also one of my favorite miles albums . he wails , and while this whole album has no words , you can get the feeling of each tune and you can tell what they are supposed to be about . miles was a genious , and this album is no exception . i think it is one of the best of his career .",99,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"in this installment of the classic gershwin opera porgy and bess , miles makes the the music come alive in a way that he can do . the music is filled with emotion . each note sends you on a journey through the lives of porgy and bess . it takes you ther in way not many works of music can do . from the power of buzzard son to the groove of summertime , this is one of miles best .",75,14

Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"arc given for honest review this one just did not do it for me . the beginning was good , it started off with a solid story line and i looked passed the okay writing . this book i found myself skimming just to get through it . i did not really find that the storyline continued in this book . we found out what ricky did really early in he book and i feel like it kind of went down from there . i did not understand the point of this book and what the plot line was going to continue to be as her ex pops in and out as well . hopefully i get a little more clarity in the next installment .",115,1
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"i loved how the heroine , belle is not a size 0 , as most of us are not , but that seems to be the draw for ricky . his rock star status does not prevent his hansome amounting side from emerging through . mostly , i love the way amy a day writes about the positive side of being plus size and loving it .",57,2
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"nice continuation of the story and you really like belle and ricky as couple and it was interesting to see belles reaction when she learned the true secret reality of her handsome new friend . her best friend julia , really needs her own story . she really was a good friend . all in all , it is a really quick and very good read . so pick up a copy when you get a chance . i received this book in exchange for an honest review by the author",83,3
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"amazing follow - up to the first book . belle and ricky can not get each other out of there heads . then ricky tracks her down and she let us him know she has figured out who he is . even with both the issues they have , they have a heat and passion , but something more growing between then . then the sleepy manager is there again . ugh . i love these two together .",66,4
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,this was a really good read book 2 pick up right where book one ended all the answers that i was looking for was finally answered . belle is still struggling with her insecurities but is trying to leave the past in the past which is looking pretty slim because her ex decide that he want her back . ricky secret is finally out it was belle best friend forever who was the one to drop the bomb to let her know that he was a rock star . which had belle with her guards up again she does not know what ricky intentions are with her since he did not tell her who he really was . both belle and ricky have trust issues . so i am looking forward to seeing what has going to happen in book 3 .,130,5
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"oh my ricky i could not put this book down . i fell more in love with ricky and belle in this book . they are amazing together . he is hot sexy and oh my god . amy you out did it on this one , thank you again for giving me the arc copy to review . i love this series",54,6
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"belle finally finds out who ricky is . he is a superstar . he is actively pursuing belle in the hottest sense . he hints at wanting more , a commitment of some kind . he is inviting belle more deeply into his life and lifestyle . of course , all the girls want him but he only had eyes for belle . ricky manager is not liking the turn of events . belle is enjoying ricky attentions very much and thinking she could get used to the lifestyle . belle is still having to deal with her cheating ex mike . she is trying to make him understand that she does not want him back . can he take a hint ? in light of her experience with her ex ; will belle be able to handle the the fact that every woman wants a piece of her man ? can she trust him not to cheat ? will ricky manager be a problem ?",146,7
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"received as arc for honest opinion once again this was a quick read and really it just gave you a little bit of what she does back home . this is where she find out that ricky is a super international rockstar and it all starts to clip of why he moves so smooth on the dance floor and can sing so good . but this does not change how she feels about him , she does not care about his money at all but she is scared about getting serious since she just ended a relationship with her ex mike who all of a sudden shows up trying to get back into the picture . book three with take us into his works and let us see how she handles it",126,8
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"the second book of this series is a hot little readricky and belle can not stay away from each other and that is ok or keep their hands off each other . to me , their love is sweet , but the way the life of a rockstar is presented seems unrealistic . one thing that took me by surprise was ricky nameis virtually identical to the name of an extremely well - known singer or celeb of our day . if you like to read romance full of hot sex and very little angst , this book is for you . i received this book in exchange for an honest review .",105,9
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"as with part one , i really liked the story and love the characters . this one seemed to go a lot faster reading wise but maybe that is because the people were already familiar to me . my favorite part is seeing the shock her ex gets when she comes home from an all night date and he is obviously overcome with jealousy . laughing out loud .",61,10
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"love it , enjoyed and can not wait for the 3rd part .",10,11
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"this was a really good book , i really enjoyed this as much as the first book can not wait for the next book .",22,12

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"celine lions voice is too amazing for words . no matter what albums i receive of hers or what style she is singing , she has amazing . but i am still extremely partial to this album . this is one of those albums where you can listen to every song and actually like or love every song . the first ad that made me appreciate her talent is still the best to me .",67,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,i bought this ad for a relative and they loved it ! i got it for the song fly which was the music for the canadian skater at the olympics and the rest of the songs were just as lovely .,39,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"i bought this ad after hearingbecause you loved me , by diane warren . a wonderfull song from the movie , up close and personal . if you ever look at the billboard charts , just check out how many songs are written by diane , what a talent when i first played the ad , and it is all coming back to be now , came on , i was hooked . what a fantastic song by meat loafs producer jim skinman . i just hate to hear this song on the radio , they cut it terrible . in my mind , i think this would have been a great opening number for barbra streisand to sing when she made her concert comeback in the early 90s . about leaving her fans , but returning where she left off , and it is all coming back to her now . if anyone thinks celine can just sing ballads , wait untill you hear river deep , mountain high . this was tina turners big hit , but celine brings down the house with her version , and mentions tina in the song . when you get to the last song , and fly comes on , you will have tears in your eyes . my mom died shortly before this record came out , and i think about her going to the light . i have four celine dion records , but this ones the best .",200,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"the final song on celine lions falling into you ad is entitled , fly and i will never be able to understand why this has not become a hit song of hers . it is perfectly beautiful and anyone who has experienced a death in their family or friends needs to hear this . it is heart wrenching yet very calming and should be heard at funeral services all the time . listen to it . it is marvelous .",74,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"this is a great ad . it has everything you will not find in the typical music of today . it is honest , raw , and melodic . whether it is the banjo and guitar picking , the duel harmonicas , the wonderful vocal harmonies , or the poignant lyrics , this album has a lot to offer . i highly recommend their other albums as well . they have a sound that really speaks to the archetypal memories of my southern roots . also , do not miss a chance to see the avert brothers live . they bring an energy to thier shows that is rare to see .",92,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"this is , i am going to , the averts best album . they have progressed and legitimately found their voice , but have not crossed the line into overproduction and unnecessary experimentation as they have in their most recent works .",34,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,the avert brothers are one of the best bands ever . i have yet to hear anything they have done that was not good . all their albums so far have been excellent .,31,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"i have seen these guys 4 times live and their show just gets better . they sing a lot of songs from this album and i have to say i love every one of them . four theives gone is my favorite . enjoy the ad , it is their best and go see them live while you can still afford it .",58,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"i discovered the avert brothers reading an article on masseur records . in doing further research , i discovered the avert brothers were former guitar students of a good friend and the avert family are friends with he and his wife . four thieves gone was more or less a random pick of their albums . i read the avert brothers had a popular stage performance and played a rock bluegrass so i was expecting music more akin to something like the nitty gritty dirt band . i have not listened to the bands other albums or a performance . but i did not hear anything in this albums that would fit the stage performance image in the article . four thieves gone may have been an studio experiment for the avert brothers . something like the battles white album was for the battles . i enjoy the album quite a bit but i am not sure fans of modern day bluegrass or even rock will agree .",156,14
