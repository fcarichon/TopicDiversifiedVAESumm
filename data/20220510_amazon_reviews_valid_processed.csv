Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"i have not used , but it have all the things for airbrush and i thing it going to work prety well , it is finish details are pretty well",27,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,great value for the price . this brush works very well and it did not cost an arm and a leg . i would definitely recommend this product to other looking for an inexpensive but well built air brush .,37,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,excellent product . the paint is delivered smoothly with excellent coverage . cleanup and maintenance is easy . i highly recommend the s62 master airbrush .,22,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i was thinking about purchasing this item when i noticed that there are two different images showing different parts . one case shows a quick disconnect and the other does not . which is correct ? giving two stars until i now exactly what comes with this product before i purchase .,48,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i am not to airbrushing and got this as an efficient and controllable way to paint small hobby parts have no idea how it works for shirts or other airbrush uses . it fits my needs perfectly and i would definitely buy this again .,44,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,this is a really nice airbrush . took me a little bit to get used to but works great . thanks for saving my day !,23,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,birth day gift for my son . he said it is smaller that what he would thought but nice products . he is using it to airbrush some doors on cars and motorcycles,28,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i bought this for body painting . my other siphon feeds did not spray fast enough for body painting and the gravity feeds take too long to change colors . with this one i can spray a small or large pattern without having streaks and color changes only takes seconds . just buy extra bottles for multiple colors . the only thing i do not like is the trigger shape . it is flat and round . i like the one on my other master airbrushes better . it has a slope to it .,86,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i just received this ab in the mail . very quick shipping ! fit and finish is excellent ! i am very impressed with the heft and overall quality . definitely recommended !,27,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"been wanting an airbrush for years and finally ordered this one my first last week . was looking forward to it and it arrived today . i was excited . the airbrush is in perfect condition , all parts listed included . then i went to connect it to the air compressor . that is where things fell flat . seems the hose and connections do not fit a standard air compressor without an adapter . that adapter is not included in the set . so , i have now ordered the adapter and must wait for it to arrive before i can use the airbrush . this company has been around for a while and i know i am not the first person to experience this . it would seem an intelligent decision to include the appropriate adapter in this set . at the very least , it should be advised in the description that this adapter is necessary for standard air compressor use . my hope was to post a picture tonight of my first airbrush artwork . unfortunately , that is not possible at this time .",170,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"used it twice shortly after receiving it and it worked fine . cleaned it according to the instructions and put it away . month or two later got it out and the only thing it does is bubble up in the paint bottle . contacted customer support and was told it is probably a dirty or defective nozzle . tried three different nozzle sets , one of which had never been used , and all acted the same way , bubbles in the paint bottle . contacted customer support again and was asked if i would like a return authorization and they would look at it . replied three times and never got a response . right now it is totally useless and there is no response from customer service .",120,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,airbrush came i or o hose . hose was replaced promptly . hooked it up and found bottle will not stay in body . just falls out . purchased new bottles and they just fall out as well . holding bottle in found airbrush would not draw material . air comes through but no material sprayed . had to disassemble to find needle jammed in so hard it could not move . should not have to fix something before you even use it ! sent e - mail to seller and received no answer at all . a waste of time and money . i will stay with my usual brand from now on . pa,99,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,there was not any instructions with it and it seems like a piece was missing from the foam insert .,18,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,had problems upon first use . buy better this one is cheap .,13,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"works as described but it never came with air hose , the one thet sent me had 1/4 1/8 ends where as i need both ends to be 1/8",29,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,hello i have ordered this product in the past i have contactextcp global couple times . never had a problem any other master series brushes love them until this one i just received 622 set . but all three needles and tips are spraying off center emailed couple times gave me a link to do cleanings did them still have problems do not know what to do i want to keep this product i like it need help,74,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"hose is not included with this even although it is prominently displayed on the web page . there is no what has included or in this case excluded anywhere in the description . i call this manufacturers fraud . amazon , to their credit , did partially reimburse the extra cost of a hose , but that does not make up for the time wasted on this and that the item is now overpriced since it does not include the hose . update : i ordered a hose only to find out that it would not fit on to the airbrush because the airbrush threaded bushing was defective . the body of the bushing flared out at the bottom and was a larger diameter than the remainder of the body . as a result of this , the bottom most threads were squashed into the adjacent threads .",133,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"cheap the hose would not even screw on gun , it looks as if gun was plated to heavy threads to thick",21,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i bought two of these sets and neither one came with a hose . the picture and description included a hose .,20,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,it is ok for the money ! i had to get a new .8 needle and tip because it wold not work . but even with the new one it still gives me a hard time . i am just going to save up for a good one,44,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"this is a nice tool . produces a nice clean spray . for the money , you can not ask for more .",18,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,very please with this airbrush for the money ! i will be purchasing more in the future,15,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"this airbrush more than exceeded my expectations . it has a nice weight to it , sprays very well and comes with three different needle sizes . it has actually outperformed some of the more expensive airbrushed i have had in the past . i will be purchasing at least one more in the future .",50,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"airbrush is the best one i have of all seven i own , i would buy again . it comes with extras i like it a lot .i give it 5 stares",31,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,nice little gun . i am just beginning so this was a good quality item for the money spent . great for the beginner or student .,24,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i was more than pleased with this airbrush system . it was a gift to my grandson and he has used the heck outta this thing . very happy with it .,29,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,if you are buying this as a complete set as pictured do not . it does not come with the air hose,20,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"product is not compatible with anything that is not master brand . all connections and fittings will not work with any other brand of compressor or fixture . such as paint cups paint jars ex . if you are not planing to use exclusively master products , and i would not its an inferior brand , than do not buy this .",53,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"paint does not want to spray for some reason , it will blow air but not paint does not .",16,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,works well with turncoat one time ! after that it stopped .,10,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i bought this kit but the paint jar was a really sloppy fit and would not hold in place . i tried some other paint jars but same story so the mount on the actual airbrush is slightly to big . so unfortunately i could not test the brush as the jar kept falling off . i have to send it back so it is a real time waster for me . very disappointed .,70,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"i am a pro i - shirt artist and purchased a set of these airbrushes . for the price of these airbrushes , you get a good valued airbrush . they are engineered copies of a top brand japanese made for less than 1/2 the price these are made in taiwan or china . yes this means that sometimes a nozzle cap may be not be machined perfectly but top global has excellent customer service and will replace anything that is not correct . these airbrushes will work for a beginner or a pro . if you want a better airbrush , then be prepared to spend more . these are not bad for the price . i can still make using these , so in my opinion , can not go wrong .",119,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,was not real impressed with this unit . i purchased this to do some detail work and the tip would clog constantly . the paint bottle would also never seat tight and fall out and make a huge mess . my harbor freight brush is a much better gun and at some amount of money delivered a much better value .,53,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,have not used it yet but it looks like it can do the job .,13,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"right out of the box the airbrush spit paint and had uneven , sporadic flow . took it apart , cleaned thoroughly and attempted to spray straight brush cleaner through it with the same results . tried another tip and the larger needle set . less air and less cleaner came out of the airbrush . put it back in the box and sent it back . my brother has the same airbrush and it works great for him . poor quality and loose manufacturing tolerances .",78,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"gave this as a christmas gift , just found out the air brush itself never worked , does not spray just bubbles in jar . an expert looked at it and said the head cap was drilled incorrectly ! this is a piece of junk , apparently they are not tested at the factory .",46,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i bought this gun to use in my gunsmithing business . i have sprayed two different guns with turncoat and has worked flawlessly . it needs to be cleaned like any other gun which is to be expected if you want to continue using it . i would recommend this airbrush for anyone getting started .,52,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,not happy with this airbrush . update just called top global they are sending a new needle . will revise if all works out . i bought this on feb 5 and the first time i used it is today march 24 . i put the .8 needle in and the airbrush blows air into the bottle . i tried spraying water thinking maybe my paint was too thick but it will not even spray water . i put the .5 needle in and it sprays . the reason i bought this is because of the flexibility of 3 needles . sometimes i need to get a bigger spray pattern or need to flow more paint . hopefully i can still return this one . at the same time i bought the g223 set and that works perfectly .,128,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,you get what you pay for . simple as that .,9,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,love it so far . now if my skill can get better .,11,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,works as good as my passage at 1/3 the price .,10,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,airbrush is above average and the price is really good but it would be five stars if all the nozzles worked . only one nozzle and needle combo worked .5 the company sent me replacements but only one of the two replacements worked . there is no quebec for the nozzles they are way out of spec . very disappointed because the airbrush is actually very good,64,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"the kit was so tempting because of the extra needles and tips . however , i had an issue i have not seen before where on my first use , the gun would blow bubbles back into the jar forcing the paint out the breather hole . it made a mess and the brush became unusable . i returned it thank you amazon and got the apache to series and the extra fan tip wich has worked fabulously for applying cerakote and other thin finishes to metal parts . the action on the apache is much smoother also . i had them both side by side and the build quality seems pretty similar with a slight edge to the apache . i have other products from mater airbrush like there mini gravity feed spray gun that work awesome so i was disappointed . i am sure i probably just got a defective one .",142,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,this airbrush is a good quality item . i have only used it a little and am still learning about it but it appears that it will do a good job in the hands of a knowledgeable person .,37,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"great air brush , easy to use , works well .",8,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"this airbrush was purchased on speculation . i wanted a replacement for my old badger . i was suspect of the price . it is really a good bargain for the price . it works more than adequately for my needs , in particular armored vehicles . i am pleased with the performance to date .",49,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,very upset want a refund came used scratches and dirt on it it is a shame,15,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"this is my first experience with airbrushing . quality seems very good for the money . my only complaint is that the supplied hose did not come with an adapter to connect to some sort of standard pipe thread so i could connect it to an air compressor . i cut one end of hose off and used a barb type connector , everything has worked just as it should since .",67,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i just got into body airbrushing and this has been a great starter airbrush . it is easy to use and easy to clean . i would recommend this for anyone starting out .,31,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"have not tried to actually use it yet , but mine did not , i repeat did not , include the quick disconnect . this is in spite of the fact that both the picture and the description say that a quick disconnect is included . very disappointed . there is not even a place in the foam insert for one . it is as if the manufacturer has dropped that piece without telling anyone . again , very disappointed . this feature is very very important to me . my one star rating will remain unless the manufacturer makes good on it .",90,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"ben nye nor wicked airbrush paints did not run smoothly through it at all . this brush requires extremely liquidated paint to spray without spattering . i know you can not just spray any paint through these , but i would expect a good quality airbrush to spray various airbrush paints . other than that , works great ! easy to clean , easy to use , wide or narrow spray rangesome amountreat starter or low priced airbrush !",63,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"this air brush lasted all of 1 minute before it clogged up , i took it apart and cleaned it all and reassembled it and it clogged up in thirty seconds or less . so far i have taken it apart three times and cleaned it and it still clogs . do not waste you money on this !",54,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"for an inexpensive airbrush , this is great . i am new to airbrushing and have found it to be very easy to use . with the 3 tips i can spray from a pencil line to a 2 stroke . i was using my friends more expensive airbrush while he was giving me some tips and the master airbrush works just as well .",60,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i bought this to paint or touch up small components in an industrial setting . so far it has worked very well . having the three different sized tips is very nice . i am not an artist and do not use this to do design work . overall i am impressed with the quality for the price .,51,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"doa on arrival , no help from seller package missing parts , and looked used . never could use , and seller has nothing but excuses . avoid this product and top global at all cost .",31,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"abysmal . i tried every possible option on this planet to make this darned thing work , all to no avail . first , the darned hose does not fit any kind of compressed air can available . so , i had to buy a hose adapter for the can . turns out , that hose adapter does not fit the hose included with this kit . so i bought a different hose . still no luck . so i bought a set of universal adapters . guess what ? they leak . finally used plumbers tape to staunch the leak , only to find that the airbrush itself does not work . it will not feed paint at all . i tried disassembling and cleaning . no luck . i even tried using water to get something i anything i to feed . i tired every setting . no luck . so now this entire kit from he shall is sitting at the bottom of my garbage can . i am pissed .",149,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,this is the 3rd master s62 i got . really good airbrush for the price,14,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,love it . runs great . easy to use . well be buying another for myself so my husband can have his back .,20,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"i bought this for hobby use , spraying epoxy coatings and it works well for the price . had to make a trip to the hardware store to connect to my shop compressor . will not attach to a sad quick connect fitting . glass jar cleans up great for repeated use .",48,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"works marginally . i use this to apply bake on finishes for firearms . the rear portion of the airbrush housing is threaded on . this portion of my airbrush can literally be pulled off with little force . it is as if the threads are several thou smaller . it will fall off in your hand with little movement . i just remove it when using the gun . i does not appear to affect the gun while painting without it but the fact that it falls off gives this thing a 3 star quality . the bottles are easy to clean and so is the gun . update : december 19 , 2015 ; so after a year the gun has quit working . i will say it has been a pretty good gun to use other than the above issues . i dropped it once on the concrete floor , rather it fell from my work bench and received a small dent in the nose cap that did not affect function however after that use the gun quit working completely . i suspect that the type of paint cerakote i was using was to blame as it clogged the gun up pretty bad . i cleaned the dickens out of it but can not get it to spray paint at all .",203,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,very fast shipping and just what it was supposed to be !,11,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i like this product it is very easy to use,9,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,this airbrush works great . i had the c16 and i did not like it as much . i am a beginner at this but the s62 is a lot less messy and easier for me to operate .,35,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i originally ordered a gravity fed airbrush and although i am sure it would have been nice for smaller task this siphon fed one has a much nicer output of air and paint and i am pleased with it is performance . thanks .,40,63
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"this airbrush is well balanced and has a solid feel . however , once in use it never worked properly . wanting to understand why it was not working properly , i dismantled the airbrush and lost the air valve casing nut . so , i ordered their repair kit major but the nut did not fit . after a couple of times trying to get the right part i gave up dealing with the seller . and so the airbrush is now a paper weight",76,64
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,not bad . you can probably find a cheaper version at the art store if you are not looking for anything super fancy . these ones have a very thin border .,28,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,i am very happy with the speedy delivery and the quality of the canvas is really good . the paints adhere more evenly than on other canvases .,26,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"no problems ever when it comes to windsor newton , it is always on time never damaged . i shall continue on ordering from here",20,2

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,appeared to be a quality canvas for a beginner . absolutely no complaints,12,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"i never used them for the project i got them for , but the quality seems mediocre . i am not an expert in canvas frames by any means , and surely anyone buying frames for professional - quality art would not be using a frame like this , but for a home art project or student or novice level work , these would probably be adequate .",57,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"i need to get more of these they are great and not too expensive , my daughter really likes to paint",20,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"i liked it , no damages , it o k.",8,7

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"these worked great for my extremely amateur needs ! best price , they are a great size , and they were easy to use . we used oil paints to make a christmas present , and it worked fine . highly recommend it if you need a nice , inexpensive set of canvasses .",46,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"better than the 11 i 14 canvas , but still have some pilling . i was of the impression they were primed and ready for painting . i am a novice , so do not know exactly what to expect on some of the products .",40,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,one of the 2 arrived dented . the wood used to stretch the canvas was defective .,15,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,good quality easy to paint . it is the first time i paint acrylic on canvas so it was enough for my needs it is 2 canvas boards white . i like the size 16x20 it is something in between small and large . height 1.5 is perfect . highly recommend it,45,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"what can i say ? it is a patch . i bought it to attach to my massif combat shirt . it is definitely the best fabric patch i have ever seen . no fraying whatsoever , authentic my , and just plain good quality . definitely recommend it .",39,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"i will make this short , as it is only a patch . price was fair . shipping was fast . patch was perfect regarding detail and stitching . the only issue is that a portion of the velcro was melted not sure why . so the upper right portion does not attach so well . other than that , it is very nice .",54,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,hard to screw up this type of product . well made and stays on my jacket .,15,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"not too thick or evey , i actually stripped the velcro off the backing and sewed it onto my hat that i stripped the velcro off of so i could see it on for a more natural look . and the path , and others i have got have all worked out remarkably well .",50,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,looks exactly as pictured . quality stitching . velcro sticks very well .,10,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"would have gotten all 5 , i honestly love all the patches in multicam from garden and culpepper . but the one in particular i received was not as detailed stitching wise , but still a good patch . i may have gotten just a less quality one ! does not scare me away from buying more from these guys in the future although !",58,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"good quality patch except for one thing . the particular section of multicam in my patch had a large section of dark brown right behind the stitching , making it hard to see or read .",33,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,quality stitching and designed to last . colors match multicam perfectly . was exactly what i expected to come from a morale patch in regards to quality .,25,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,put this patch on an actual cry precision op cap and the material is a perfect to the cry multicam . i am not sure but this may be the cry textile under license .,32,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,this is a high - quality patches good velcro . the embroidery is very well - done with no frays . i bought several patches and enjoy them,22,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"patch was okay , but a bit smaller than i anticipated , so text was pretty small and hard to read unless up close . was nice that it had velcro already sewn on .",31,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"i do not know if i just got a lemon or what . seems like a good patch , well stitched as far as i know . received it promptly . multicam ? maybe . maybe the worst selection of multicam fabric available to the maker . mine has three colors and seems like it would fit with my old bus better than my multicam uni . the embroidery on the snake and quote seem a little lacking too . i would not buy another one or wear it on my uni but i will slap it on a range bag or something . i noticed one person said it will go great with their condor hat . if you are the type of person who has no problem with the quality condor offers then this patch will suit your needs . overall not upset because the price was not a gouge to my pocketbook . hopefully garden and culpepper have some other products that will suit my needs . i usually give a company two or three tries . this was their first strike .",167,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"i love this patch , super durablesome amounts great with my multicam ball cap from condor and it goes great with my multicam uniform . love it !",25,18

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,lovely selection of greenery to cut ahead in variety of shades so i am ready to create .,16,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,pretty dies but extremely small . i liked that this included smaller versions of several of the sizzle steel dies . but i was hoping to use a few of them for felt and they are just so small they pull apart immediately . the stems are so thin i am not even sure they would work well with yardstick . but i am sure they would be pretty on very sturdy yardstick for a card . i would skip them if you are thinking of felt . even doubled up or stiffened felt they will not work .,84,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"the dies cut well , but the leaves are way to small for my purposes . i really do not know what i can use them for . they could be a nice addition to small flowers only . i would have much preferred fewer dies in a larger , more usable size . as is , they are a waste of money !",55,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,for felt crafting i thought that i would like these but they are much smaller than i expected . for paper they would probably work really well .,26,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,images i needed and some new ones to try . nice set .,11,10

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,love them . not exact measurements but close enough .,8,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"these are pretty foliage dies and i am glad that i purchased them . i use a big shot with the precision plate and they cut well . i expected the leaves to have veins or some detail to emboss but they do not so i am a bit surprised by that because tim holt's products usually include small details such as this . overall , i really like them and drew in some veins and embossed some with a pointy tool .",77,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,my fault for not reading the mini part . but i got this tape for indicating injury on my gi at martial arts and it does the job perfectly . even stays on after a few washes so i do not have to re - tape every class .,43,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"ok . sleep deprived mom here . read the measurements . it is 3/4ths of an inch thick . it looks like a regular size role in photo , but is not . do it be like me . so . small . still good tape . but can not do what i need . i will go get more sleep now . joanna has it full price for some amount of money you can use a coupon to make it half off .",64,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,this is a tiny tiny tiny role of duct tape . not normal size ! pay attention to listed dimensions .,18,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"read the product size laughing out loud , you can get this tape in this size cheaper than this elsewhere . other than that it is duck tape , you know what to expect",28,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,gave these to my daughter she has 56 years old and she has enjoyed them very much . i was delighted that they fit !,22,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,it is duct tape and does what it should .,8,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,it is mini . thought i was getting a regular roll . look at dimensions before purchasing i nice quality tape .,19,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,great product . was exactly as described and came right away .,10,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"my own fault , i suppose for not reading the entire product details . i feel ripped off . it is tiny , but costs the same as a standard size .",26,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,i thought this was the big roll of duck tape .,10,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,tiniest roll of duct tape ! did not realize i was not getting a tankard size roll of tape .,16,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"beware ! read the reviews and the description before you buy this product . everything this seller does from the photo to the price leads you into believing the product is legitimate ; however , it is smaller than a roll of scotch tape .",40,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,exactly as orderedtake note it is 0.75 inches wide so it is not as wide as standard duct tape . that is what i was looking for although .,28,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,those buyers who left poor feedback are idiots . they clearly can not read . the product clearly describes the 0.75 inch size of the width of this tape . why give the seller less than 5 stars if you the buyer are the ones that can not read . the product is exactly has described and is exactly what i was looking for and needed . thank you shurtech for the tape . it is perfect ! i will buy more as needed .,75,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,it is tiny . my fault for not reading the description but shame on this company for charging so much for this product . bought a normal sized roll of duck tape for the same price .,33,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,not much to say about this product other than that it is exactly as advertised and it made my shoes super cool and cute .,24,0

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,these crystals were beautiful on my christ tree wall hanging . just the added sparkle really made a difference . the swarovski items are certainly a cut above the others .,28,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,these were poor quality and would not work with my hot fix gun . they would fall out . wasted a. few and gave up using some nice ones i had bought at a bead store in town . they were not very sparkly . can not believe they are swarovski . i returned them no problem for a refund .,52,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"shiny and stay on well , no problem washing",8,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,the jewels tend to fall off after a few washing even on the delicate cycle and hanging to dry . but they work great when used on the invitations we make .,30,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,do not look like swarovski crystals . they are very very clouded compared to the real sparkly clear swarovski crystals . definitely not crystal clear . these were actually the replacement shipment for my first order . my first order i received flashbacks and they actually were crystal clear but not the hottie that i wanted .,50,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"cheap ! not like the picture shown , would expect this off of ebay not amazon !",14,12

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"they are not easy to apply but they look beautiful . a lot of patience required for application , a very nice result .",23,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,used the crystals as embellishment for stage costume . sparked wonderfully when stage lights shine on them ! i highly recommend these for the dance costumes !,24,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,i am still in the process of bringing up a bandana that i folded to wear as a headband . it is turning out just as i had imagined . these are very clear and give me all the bling i hoped for .,41,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,these look good i have not yet used any of these . i am looking forward to that . can not wait to shine,21,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,sparkly sparkling rhinestones ! very nice . i would order these again . heat set works great . nice and clear rhinestones look great !,20,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,great rhinestones and easy to apply . they come in many colors . the hot fix tool works really well and the stones look great on stage !,25,23

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i bought these a year ago finally used them , wow they shine so bright ! i ran out and bought a cheaper kind that came like in bulk , big mistake . next to these the other crystals looked very cloudy opaque , these may cost a bit more , but u get what you pay for . they dried perfectly on the satin shoes i placed them on .",65,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i love swarovski crystals and these were perfect for the project i was working on . easy to apply using a heat tool . nicely packaged , quick order or deliver turn around time and a great price .",33,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,these stones were brilliant and as expected . glimmered in their bag and expect them to do so on the dress i am making .,23,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,this was my first purchase of hot fix stones and what a great product and had fun bedazzling items for new grand daughter,23,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,beautiful stones but a little more expensive than i like . my mother makes flower brooches and would have to charge a lot more for them if she used these stones .,30,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"they sparkle better , have more lead content in the glass , and they adhere well to fabrics . what has not to like ?",20,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,i love these ! they add the perfect sparkle to just about anything . i have transformed inexpensive tank tops into something special for vacations or anytime !,25,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i have not counted or tried them yet and i will keep them , but i have swarovski crystals i bought at a store and these lack brilliance and sparkle . if these are swarovski crystals , i am angelina jolie not !",37,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,i am a first time buyer and user to this product . i like the quality and the price . i would order them again .,23,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i love these crystals ! they have a lot of fire ! i would definitely buy a lot more , and recommend anyone who crafts to get them too ! great company to deal with !",31,35

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,i purchased these along with a hot fix heat tool and they worked amazing . we were making shirts for work and we used the crystals on cotton tees . they could not have turned out better if we would have bought them at the store ! they have stayed put after several washes too ! love them !,52,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,the rhinestones are very nice and the right size for my floral project ! i was very impressed ! will be ordering more !,21,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i wanted to use this on my phone , and they are beautiful . there are enough rhinestones to cover it and my ipod too .",23,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,rhinestones were good quality . i was surprised at the small amount of rhinestones i received for the price . apparently you get a little for a lot of money .,28,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,junk will not affix went back to the same ones i bought from hobby lobby no issues,17,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i love the effect of these hottie crystals in my fiber work . in the past , i have used them sparingly , but my latest project requires a lot of bling so i purchased this package of 144 . i liked that there was a blink to the company and a card which shows all the colors they make which i can keep for further reference .",62,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i am very happy and i love it . thank you , [ . ]",11,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,love these ! i ordered them for my wedding to bling my converse out and they truly do sparkle and shine ! i get compliments on how sparkly they are and ask where i got the rhinestones from and they are shocked when i tell them i ordered from amazon and give them the link to this seller ! not only was the seller fast with shipping but the rhinestones were exactly as stated and loved them !,74,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,these are the neatest little things . i use them to put on top of special gifts . can put a beautiful little flower arrangement on top . and it looks spectacular !,27,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,10 out of 12 of these minis were no longer glued to their base upon arrival of the packagenot sure what the problem here but i now have to glue each piece of foam back to the base if identification like to use them .,46,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,"we received the order quickly . it was just as promised online . we may not use it for making the pew bows that we intendedbecause making the bows is a lot more time consuming than i realized . however , the product can be used for other things .",47,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,arrived crushed were not in box as displayed . over half of them unstable . do not purchase ! waste if money !,19,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,to small for my need could not do anything with also crushed,13,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,these were adorable ! i added the little battery rice lights and we tied back curtains .,15,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,"many of these arrived broken and were a crushed crumbly mess . i had enough undamaged ones to use for my project so i did not send them back but beware if you need all of them , that you may encounter some broken ones . they undamaged ones worked great for mini flower arrangements .",52,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,these were perfect for embellishing an evergreen table garland for 40 foot long wedding reception tables !,17,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,they are smaller than i expected but will work perfectly on wine bottles !,13,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,"these are fantastic for arranging fresh flowers in small containers . they stick to the bottom of the container and hold in place very well , even when wet . wish i had found them years ago .",34,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,these can work really well for small projects but to echo other reviewers you should order more than you need . in my last pack of 12 one the foam came completely detached while soaking and a couple others crumbled . you should not submerge them in water because that will ruin the adhesive . they are really expensive for how small and unreliable they are .,61,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,i bought these to decorate some lanterns for window decorations for my daughters wedding where just a few flowers were needed to accent the foliage and ribbons . awesome product !,29,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,the balls came unglued from the plastic . it needs to have a cage over it .,15,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,most of these worked really well for making floral decorations on wine bottles . i had problems with the adhesive and the foam breaking away from the plastic on quite a few .,31,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,these make decorating with fresh flowers a breeze !,8,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,i put these in a basket of gardening tools that i gave to my sister who loves to garden . it was the perfect little something that you would never think to buy for yourself . she loved them and her arrangements from her garden look great .,45,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,love the mini decks . i was sticking it from cake box to picture frame,14,16
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,the brush that i received was covered with dust as if it has been used to sweep dusty floor for a while .,22,0
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"first time i used it the handle broke right off , i had not used it more then a few hours . very disappointed , returned for a refund .",25,1
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,this is a well crafted car wash brush . the brush head is nice and wide which makes washing your car or truck easy and quick . the handle is well fabricated and comfortable to utilizesome amountreat product and great shipping !,37,2
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"bought this to be able to clean an re . handle is long and sturdy , and adjustable in length . brush is soft and thick and does a nice job of holding water and cleaning the re . overall quality seems very good . recommended .",41,3
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,easy to use on my toyota highlander since i can not reach over the top . would be perfect for min ivan,20,4
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"initial use was washing campers awning and was super both in handling suds and scrubbing as well as rinsing ! and flexible length was just perfectable to reach clear to back , wind - up , portion of awning ! strength enough to scrub even when fully extended ! and head able to carry the soap up to awning while scrubbing ! best one i have used ! d.",61,5
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,foam handle do not stay in place after getting wet . they slide up and down the pole .,17,6
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,i have boats and cars . saw this in the store for twice as muchused my phone price checker and amazon had it . ordered it for 1/2 standing right there . this is a really nice brush . just a note : came in a box the size of a car hood .,50,7
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,very well built . worth every penny . i have 2 for washing the boat and car .,15,8
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"about the right size , soft bristles , removes dirt well where scrubbed . you can really tell where this brushed was used ; it is a lot cleaner then any spot you miss . it is a bit heavy , due to the hefty and sturdy extension pole , which makes horizontal surfaces easier to scrub but vertical ones harder to scrub since the brush is always want to drop downwards . however , the sturdy extension pole will hold up to lots of use as a results . personally , 4 feet alone is plenty long enough to clean my car so i will not be using that feature . the flow through feature is pretty useless and i will not be using it . i just sort of dumps water out the very center . it has zero spread throughout the brush . just use the hose alone for much better and faster control of any water . i use a foaming cannon to soap down the car which only takes seconds and does hosing off afterwards . brush is about the right size 10 for a relatively quick scrubbing while getting a majority of the curved surfaces but also get a smaller brush as well . nice grips make rotation of brush easier .",199,9
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,does not scratch my paint ! have not hooked it up to my hose or anything but as a stand alone brush for a short girl with a suv it does the job !,31,10
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,works great for washing my suv . the handle extension is perfect for reaching the roof . love having the water attached for rinsing .,22,11
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"plastic hose fittings are not sturdy enough . broke after 1st use , now it is a brush on a long stick !",19,12
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"purchased it for my honda pilot and it really helps me alot to clean my suv quick and throughly . it makes huge differences when you need to clean top of your suv or any other tall vehicles . only downside is that , with arm fully extended , you may find it slightly heavy . however , i would strongly recommend it if you do clean your vehicles at home often .",65,13
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"i bought this item because i saw a neighbor using something similar and thought wow , what a great way to clean a martha looks so easy ! . in the end , i suppose i was wrong . i find it easier to wash the car using mitts and a bucket . the product itself is built reasonably well , although some of the adjustments do not stay put as well as i would like . it is solid , easy to connect to a hose and the flow - thru is adjustable and works well . the brush will not scratch the car , but it also does not do very well in getting anything like bugs off of the car . i see this is most useful for an initial rinse off or scrubbing . but again , i think mitts are more useful if you have enough of them .",135,14
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,works great ! i use it on the windows and siding on my house and highly recommend it !,17,15
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,works fine ; but i should have read the description more closely ; i thought it also had a built - in soap dispenser which is what i was really looking for .,28,16
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,the water pressure drops considerably when using the hose attachment .,10,17
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"i had another brand which was getting worn out . the other one had basically one stream of water squirting out the middle which was useful when you wanted to just rinse what you had just washed . this one the water does not squirt out , it just gushes out . it is better for spreading more water into the brush but useless for rinsing . i guess you can not have it both ways . also , the various joints need to be tightened often or they begin to leak but not a huge deal , just twist them tight again .",92,18
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"best car wash brush ever . it is soft , water runs through it like a band of sailors on leave and grime leaves my car as if one dedicated devil dog was scrubbing it with a toothbrush .",36,19
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,this is a rugged one with the strong brace at the brush where they always break !,16,20
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,nice soft brush . i am using it to wash my solar panels . the extension pool is not . that long .,20,21
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,very easy solution for a quick touch up without the expense of a car wash .,15,22
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,bristles are coming out after one use and leaks terribly at handle even after adding new hose washers . handle was also much shorter than i thought it would be . probably be in our next garage sale .,36,23
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"water runs down the shaft when upright down your arms , and you get pretty wet by the the time your done washing your camper .",24,24
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,works getsome amountove the extension handle . brush is very soft to clean the entire motorhome .,15,25
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"i enjoyed using this , it is put together well and dose the job",12,26
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,broke within the first 5 minutes of use .,8,27
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,my husband had me buy this for him to use to wash the vehicles and our 30 it camper . works great .,20,28
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,nice brush and telescopic handle . price is even better,9,29
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,works great and used it a lot on the re already,11,30
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,got this for my boyfriend who loves to wash his cars . great for getting the hard to reach spots and the top of the truck .,25,31
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,my husband got this for washing his car and he loves it . he loves it !,15,32
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"this thing is great . every neighbor that has seen it has asked about it . makes washing a big truck a good bit more manageable than it would be with a sponge . not quite sure what parts are known to because cancer , so that was slightly disconcerting , but i guess everything causes cancer these days . the connections do not leak , but it is sometimes a pain to get them screwed together and you have to use focused force to make sure everything is going to stay in place once you get it adjusted to your desired length . the head fits into a standard some amountallon bucket ok , so dipping into soap solution is not a big deal i was worried it would not fit . i find that 6 soap stops and subsequent rinses are enough to complete a 4 door ram 1500 .",137,33
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"the handle has a constant tendency to slide off and give you a bath . drilled a hole and put a nut and bolt to secure and stopped the sliding off . it is great for washing windows , which is why i purchased it . would have got 5 stars if they built in a stop / lock for the handle .",57,34
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,amazing ! i will be purchasing another one ! easy to wash my car and suv . soft and easy to handle . perfect !,20,35
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,it is very well made . definitely helps with washing the hard to reach spots on my car .,17,36
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"very good and well made , it can withstand any type of scrubbing and washing .",15,37
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"i try to keep my truck clean . i do a lot of work with the local fire department and i get real grief when i show up to a fire with a dirty red truck . a brush with flow - through water makes it easy to keep the truck washed of in any weather and this brush is soft enough to be safe for any finish . the head is a little larger than some and will not get into some tight spaces but that would be true for almost any brush of this type . the only reason i did not give it 5 stars , is the plastic hardware where the hose connects . it does not seem sturdy and i feel it would break easily if dropped on the ground . for this reason , i keep an expandable hose attached to it all of the time so i will not have to constantly connect and disconnecthopefully safer for the fittings . if this is the kind of brush you need , i would recommend it . it is the best of this type i have ever used .",175,38
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,never got to use it due to handle being bent and the handle would not slide to extend . it did not appear bent as much as it seems oval or swelled in the handle . i also have a 93977 and it is great but the 93097 is the on i really wanted .,52,39
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,nice soft bristle brush . good handle . works like it is supposed to . highly recommend !,14,40
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,great quality . soft bristles . love that you can control the amount of water going through the wand .,17,41
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"works okay . the one i received from amazon was damaged bristles were flattened on half the brush . after returning the brush , i found the it same brand and model brush for a much lower price at walmart . i gave it another try . ,",42,42
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,water leaks at the seams . cleans the vehicle well although .,10,43
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"this is a really great carwash brush , with lots of lengthsome amountreat durability , and nice bristles on the head . the foam handles keep my hands from blistering , and the brush speeds up my carwash time significantly .",36,44
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"works great perfect for my truck , brush could be a little bigger but no complaints .",15,45
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,much better than a similar brush that i got at the hardware store . the extendable wand is a great help .,20,46
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"this brush remains rigid even under pressure applied . i have used it on my truck and my wifes suv for the top surfaces . for the sides i prefer a hand mitt . it will hold soap well , and have not seen any webbing caused by it . very happy with it !",49,47
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"this product is ok . brush did clean well and water flow worked well . however , the water control valve moves too easily while cleaning probably just my hand position and can not always keep it set on the low or high setting . i did like that although it has two setting for high and low , you can control the flow to almost any water pressure . but it moves too easily , even when you do not want to move it . i did not like that the head is flat and not angled , which makes it hard to angle brush for higher and farther to reach places . the head will also need regular tightening as fitting easily comes loose . it would be ideal if the brush head could be adjustable . i ended up cleaning our vehicle without the water hose attached , which i found to be fastersome amountighter , and easier to control .",147,48
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,brush does a great job of cleaning my cars without scratching them . the extension is the right size to get across my suv end to end and allows me to clean it in record time with little effort . good price too !,41,49
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"works as advertised , water flows through while scrubbing . not much else to report , if you are looking for a simple brush to help build a good lather , this one works fine . no issues encountered so far .",35,50
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"the attachment for the hose popped off the very first time i used it tried to attach it several ways , but it did not work . very disappointed in that feature . however , even without the hose , just using it with a soapy bucket of water it was still very easy to use and all of the extensions were fine .",57,51
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"i bought this for my husband , who had trouble washing the top of his pickup . he says it works really well .",21,52
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"easy to use . very soft bristles . good price , this is a good buy if you want a good brush for washing your auto .",23,53
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,i used this a couple of times and it broke where you tighten the plastic piece to lengthen or shorten pole .,21,54
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"chose 5 star because of the quality and the other reviews on this product and it is made very well , sturdy , and affordable . my husband appreciated it since it will make his job washing the re awning easier , and more",38,55
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"the bristles are bent and so far do not straighten , i expect the product to arrive in good condition . if you have an idea to fix the problem fine , but as of now i would not re - order",37,56
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"i wash my car more often now , i do not known how i managed with out it . great product . i recommend it .",22,57
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"reasonably well - made of metal aluminum ? and plastic nylon ? . threaded onto the end of the handle is an extension that has a lever on it that you can slide from off to full . handy . i keep it on the end of the hose at all times now . brush is soft . it is easy to clean , too . so you do not risk scratching the paint on the next vehicle you wash with road dirt from the last one . we have three full - size vans . most of the time i clean them with one of those as - seen - on - to car wash wands that has three water patterns and a soap dispenser . if there has dirt that does not wash off with the soapy water , i use the brush . not much else to say , really . it is a pretty simple device that is built well - enough to last a few years , maybe , if you are careful with it , but certainly not a lifetime .",148,58
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"the brush is very soft , so i felt comfortable using this to wash my car . the brush is removable and every so often i would have to tighten it back onto the pole .",33,59
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"this item was made to last , sturdy not flimsy . i would recomend it be stored with the brush end up since the bristles are thin and would bend out of shape if left on the floor to dry . thin bristles no marring of car finish and this is what we all hope for .",54,60
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"wish it were a little longer for my re , but otherwise great . what else can i say ? i recommend it .",20,61

Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"this was a little hard to get on the brake pedal . once on it was nice and tight , no problem with it coming off .",24,3

Automotive,B000FQ7R32,my jeep needed new ones for the brake and clutch . i ordered two and promptly received them . they fit perfectly and look stock . i recommend this product .,27,5

Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"fits like it should on my 1983 cj7 . nice and thick rubber , not cheap feeling at all .",17,9
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,pad is a little thicker than original and also does not seem to be as tight on the metal . i hope it holds up . will post update if anything changes . it went on my 1981 jeep cj7 .,37,10
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,fits my jeep cj-7 brake pedal perfectly . i have ordered another for the clutch pedal,14,11

Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"i bought this radiator because of it is great reviews but after only two months the radiator is spraying coolant from the coils within it . here is a picture to show what i mean . i thought it may be that my cap had simply gone bad and was not sealing , but after replacing it with a brand new cap i am still losing coolant that is spraying from within the radiator as demonstrated . i am not sure if i just got a rare bad apple of a radiator or perhaps you get what you pay for . it seems most other people had better luck with theirs .",103,0
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,i have always heard good things about koto radiators . i put one in a car in february of this year . the radiator is leaking coolant all the way across the top where the plastic meets medal .,36,1
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,as of this date mine arrived in perfect condition and is the sought after koto brand with a small ty sticker on the box . this is an incredible deal on a top of the line brand like koto . local auto parts stores are double the price and are cheaply made brands not near the quality of koto . glad i found out about this deal from the mata forums they all seam to agree that this is the best replacement radiator for the mata .,83,2
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"this is a koto radiator removed as a ty , a great radiator at a great price . works with automatics and manual transmissions .",22,3
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"gave 5 stars because it works . however neither a packing box nor a radiator itself had any mentioning of koto . it works , so who cares .",26,4
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,this is the closest thing you can get to an poem replacement radiator for the na mata 1990 - 1997 . why bother attempting to repair a radiator when you can buy a new one for under some amount of money shipped ?,36,5
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"came nicely and safely packed in a koto box . very easy to install . only decision is how to handle the side rails . you can either remove the mounting studs and mounting bolt grommets from the rails on your old radiator and install them on the rails on the new rad will require some prying out of the old grommets and removing a i - clip for each stud , or , simply transfer the old side rails studs and grommets and all from your existing radiator to the new one using just 2 bolts each . either way , pretty easy . then you just transfer your existing fans from the old radiator to this new on take the old rad and fans out of the car as one unit , makes it easier , 4 bolts per fan , and drop the new rad with the fans into the car . nothing to it . one of the most cost - effective and easiest improvements i have made to my 95 mata . i highly recommend this part !",166,6
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,i ordered one of these based on what i would read on miata.net . received a koto radiator in a koto box . fit was perfect in my 91 with manual transmission .,29,7
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"someone on the mata forum had mentioned they bought this ty radiator and that it arrived in a koto box and with a koto part number so someone , for whatever reason , is branding them and selling them really inexpensively . i used koyoi extensively on refurbishing mates and never had one fail and was pleasantly surprised to see that this is a genuine product without even an attempt to disguise the packaging . for the price it sells for on amazon , it simply can not be beat .",84,8
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,i do not know what ty brand is but what i received was a koto 1140 radiator ! fit perfectly ! you only need to keep two bolts from your old radiator that are held by i - clips and are what keep the radiator balanced in your mata !,45,9
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"direct replacement for a factory radiator with cracked upper tank . all i work on is mates and this is my go - to radiator for stock replacement . good price , fast shipping , quality unit , poem figment with no issues . i have probably installed over 20 of these and will continue to use them .",49,10
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,it fit like a glove in my 93 mata . i took longer to install than i had hoped but that was unrelated . i will no doubt be back in ten years to buy another .,34,11
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,great fit on 91 mata 5 - speed . one flaw to be aware of the drain plug is terrible . use a huge phillips head or even a butter knife to open it the plastic is super soft .,33,12
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"poem fit , but it is aluminum . the best of both worlds",10,13
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,fit perfectly into my manual 1993 . just had to transplant the hooks by removing or reinstalling the snap rings that kept them in place on the original radiator .,26,14
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,great replacement . change your hoses now too . the transmission cooler connections stay capped and do not get in the way . very pleased . we will see about long term .,26,15
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"installed very easily a few years ago and still works great , no complaints so far .",15,16
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"cured my overheating issues in a 1990 mata . holds more coolant than the oe manual trans radiator since it is designed for an automatic needs the extra capacity for the transmission cooler . the drain plug is a huge step down from ofits made out of a soft plastic and is roughly sized for a 3 phillips bit , unlike the oe which uses a 2 or ideally the closest is size . threads are different than the oe plug so unfortunately you can not re - use it .",85,17
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,i have bought two radiators from these guys and i love the quality . exact fit for each radiator . one was a vision brand purchased 2 years ago and the other was ty . maybe the same company but different name ?,39,18
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,perfect fit on my 1997 i edition mata . i manuel transmission . great product,12,19

Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"this is the one to get for na mata . perfect match to poem , just swap over the rubber grommets . fans fit exactly . tip : make sure it is the one fulfilled by amazon .",31,22
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,delivered very quick . mechanic friend had no problems installing along with new thermostat . price was great !,16,23
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"fit my 96 mata just great ! not that it is an issue , but be sure to save the mounting brackets from the old radiator . this does not come with them . good thing i had not thrown out the old one yet before i realized it !",43,24
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"poem quality , this radiator has been going strong for quite some time now .",13,25
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"put this in a 1990 mada mata after the previous one decided to just start spontaneously draining it is coolant all over the place . installation was simple and this fit in perfectly , no problems with leaks or temperatures . ended up selling the car and they have not had any problems either . probably good to note that the owner after me drove every day like he was autocrossing and it never overheated .",69,26
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,fit great but be sure to save the little bit parts when you remove the old one : they will likely come in handy when you get the new one .,28,27
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,fit perfectly and does the job it was designed to do .,11,28
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"perfect fit for my 92 mata with manual transmission , a or i , and power steering .",13,29
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,i did not receive the konrad radiator made in japan that many of the reviews i read referenced to . instead i received a ty brand radiator made in china . i went ahead and installed it but based on the recent reviews posted on this radiator it does not look too promising .,50,30
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"perfect fit , easy installation , works as well as the old one !",11,31
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"this radiator looks to be well made but i believe the quality of the plastic tank is sub par . let me explain why . approximately 2 months after installing the radiator my head gasket wet out i no fault of the radiator , just bad luck i and overheated the motor . afterwards i found the seating surface for the cap was deteriorated . i believe this was from the overheating . i have repaired the engine and cleaned up the seating surface as best i could it does not hold pressure and it runs cool and i have had no issues all summer .",97,32
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"junk , crooked . brand came was ty made in chinasome amounteaked by week 1 across the top .",16,33
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"decent quality radiator . it appears at least as well made as the factory original from the outside . time will tell about the core itself . it was an exact fit and easy install in my 97 mata . everything lined up perfectly . an hour drive at 95 degrees outside with the ac blasting to test , and the temp gauge never crept above the low end of the normal range .",67,34
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"everything swapped across we no problems ; radiator went in like poem , and is working well . was shipped in excellent condition .",20,35
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"perfect fit on my 1990 mata . can not beat the price . as others have noted , if you have a it , just ignore the at cooling section .",25,36

Automotive,B000IYPNC8,no complaints ; works as advertised ; fits my mata perfectly ; arrived in 2 days .,13,50
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"i received mine as a lysol radiator , not koto like others have commented . it came with the automatic outlets , but i just left the plugs on those and it fit perfectly on my 5 speed with ac . when i took the original radiator out , i measured the thickness to be about 16 my . this lysol radiator was about 26 my and the fans sit nice and flush with the fins , so i am getting a bit more cooling too !",76,51
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"read about these actually being koyorads on the mata forums and decided to give it a try . showed up in a brand new sealed konrad box with appropriate stamping on the radiator . it is a perfect fit when using factory radiator brackets , and took about 30 minutes to change . this is one of the best deals i have found as far as poem style radiator goes , and would definitely recommend buying this unit .",71,52
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"well worth the money , only complaint was one of the captive nuts was not threaded so one of the bolts on the side mounts was missing . i had to remove one from the old radiator and find a bolt for it . no biggie .",43,53

Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"i am not a motorhead and this was my first radiator replacement . my son teamed up with me to make it a father - son project and we knocked it out and exactly one hour . even for a couple guys that do not crank wrenches frequently , it was a piece of cake . the earlier comments that advised keeping the rails off the original radiator were spot on . that was the best advice i could have received and after swapping the rails , everything worked perfectly . there was nothing about this radiator that caused the problem , nothing needed special attention , modification or whatever . everything just slid in perfectly . it was actually a lot of fun and a sense of accomplishment for a couple it guys , father and son , messing around on a saturday afternoon .",129,56
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"this is the factory koto radiator for auto or standard trans . perfect fit , same as my 24 year old , 104k mile original rad . manual trans leave the auto trans cooling tubes plugged , use your old mountssome amounts right in . 5 stars ! bargain !",42,57
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,it is for the automatic transmission mata . i just capped off the transmission cooler hookups and the radiator matched up exactly to my 1990 mada mata 5 speed . could not be happier !,31,58
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"comes with side rails , but i transferred my old rails since it was easier , i purchased through amazon warehouse and the box was beat but the radiator was in good shape .",31,59
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,i forgot how much room i gave up with an oversized radiator . installing this gave me much more room to check belts and such . it is of good quality .,29,60

Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"the dealer wanted 600 to replace . with a little patience and some garage tunes , this was actually fun to replace . everything fit well . 1994 mata mx5",27,66
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"note : when i tried to order this for my 93 mata , i kept getting a pop - up from amazon that said it would not fit my car , but i decided to trust some of the reviews that said it would . it fit perfectly !",41,67
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"ordered wednesday , arrived friday using amazon prime from amazon stock . it is in a konrad box marked made in indonesia , although i could find no markings on the radiator itself , just an inspected by sticker . everything looks fine and i do not really care if it is genuine koto as long as it works . it really seems likely that all of the plastic parts are made in the same factory because how many mates are there in the world to support multiple sources ?",82,68
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"just received and installed this on my 97 . it is replacing a 5 - year old koto radiator which clearly has a koto sticker branding on it , stating made in indonesia . this new radiator has no stickers or branding ; just some embedded letters indicating it is model number , which makes me a percentage sure that it is not a koto . the sealed box it came in has no branding or company name whatsoever , except model numbers and the words made in china . that being said , the build quality and materials seem exactly the same as my koto . fit is the same with one important consideration : i needed to use my cordless drill to slightly enlarge the two large holes that the locking pins go through on the side rails of the radiator , which end with an open lock washer . the stock pins were too large for the pre - drilled holes in the new radiator . although it literally took 1 second to enlarge each hole , this still must be noted . i am very happy with the radiator , price , quality , and overall value . the product would have been perfect except for the hole issue which was an easy fix as long as you have a drill . i still highly recommend this radiator , although . great buy .",204,69
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"this is the one that is just like the poem , a perfect fit . it has the extra tubes for an auto transmission , do not worry about that although , you can only get auto transmission radiators for the early model mates any more , from anywhere i have seen . manual transmission owners just ignore the two extra tubes , no need to cap them off .",60,70
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"drop in figment , just move over a little hardware . works great , comparable to original factory radiator , except no leaks ! very shiny as well .",23,71
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"lowest price i could find , packaged well , working great . installed very easily and included all hardware i required some of my bolts seized and broke the clips when i took out the old unit .",34,72

Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"as other reviews say , this is a koto radiator for an amazing price . installation was a breeze follow the mata . net guide if unsure . it fits my 91 perfectly , and i now have a few hundred miles on it with no problems at all . only thing i would add is to use the old side rails from your replaced radiator instead of the shiny new ones attached to this replacement , as they have the grommets and mounting pins already in place .",82,77
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"high quality inexpensive replacement radiator for my 1993 mata . dropped in with no problems , everything lined up perfectly . highly recommended .",20,78

Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"just slid right in , no problems . have only had it in for about a 100 miles or so but everyone on the mata forum recommends them . good enough for me .",30,82
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"as of april 2013 this is still a koto radiator . it was relatively easy to install and seems to be close to original poem radiator in terms of quality . a few of the fins were bent in from shipping a presume but not enough to affect performance . i chucked the side rails that came with the koto and used the rails from the original radiator since they had the rubber grommets.and the koto did not . also , the screw holes for the fans were not as precise as original radiator but with a little effort i was able to get them all in . no radiator cap was included so keep the one from original rad , it was a perfect fit . have not had a chance to drive much since installation but it is doing it is job so far . overall i am pleased with my purchase .",142,83
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,poem fit 1995 1.8l mata with a good price . i think i had to transfer some clips or fasteners from my current radiator to the new one .,27,84
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"i can not recommend this because it fell off . it does not really have a way to attach to the wires , it just depends on the steal bits that make contact . that does not work , as i discovered .",36,0
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"this clip made it extremely easy to replace a corroded end of a wiring harness . the package includes both the trailer and and the vehicle ends of the wire . it only took a few minutes to install , and most of that was getting the old wiring end off . i only wish it had come with a dust cap to prevent future corrosion . i ended up ordering one , also from hopkins that has the test led lights right on the dust cover .",81,1
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"easy to install . it can be reused . great for making your own harness . seven more required words , use heavier wire !",20,2
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"if you have to fix 4 - way flat trailer wiring , this is a must have . depending on where the damage is , you may be able to avoid having to splice in a new cable . it is especially handy when you need to replace the end on a i - connector , or if you just want to shorten one . no more messy splices . it is also a handy way to shorten the i - connector wiring when the wire to the 4 - way connector is way too long . i had 2 coiled up behind the bumper .",89,3
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,this worked well for my needs . easy to install and a little silicone gasket maker to the back and you will have to worry about water or dirt getting into the wires and corroding them .,34,4
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,product came quickly and fixed a trailer that we bought without having to splice the wires . this fixed a problem that i thought i would have to re - wired my trailer . worth the investment .,33,5
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"i was very pleased to see how easily the connectors went together , using 16 and 18 awe insulated wire . a small packet of silicon grease is included to help keep moisture from corroding the contacts . used a pair of regular slip - joint pliers to assist in getting the protective cover to snap into position .",53,6
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"i mesh up my newly installed 4wire towing harness when it hit the roadside gutter and crush the end connector . i did not secure it at higher location and i just let it hang under the receiver . i thought i will need to replace everything , but when i tried to browse for a replacement , i saw this quick fix just for the ends . cheaper and easier , rather than to replace everything . only took me less than 2 minutes to fix the end connection .",83,7
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,great idea to keep in the back of your truck just in case . remember to have a pair of pliers to close it .,23,8
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"self crimps just like the direction says . in order for this to work properly , you must be using the correct gauge wire .",22,9
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,just what i was looking for ! a great plug repair that can be done in the field in 5 minutes . i plan to go back and actually solder the connections to make a permanent fix . what has really neat is you do not lose any wire if you cut the old plug off flush at the base . i searched all over the internet for just this very thing and was pleased to find this . so glad to not have joints midstream in the harness .,82,10
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,awful . waste of money . it might be good if you had exactly the gauge of wire that it was designed for and it would require that the jacket on the wire is also the perfect composition . this was the second set that i tried and i am so completely disappointed . buy a wire kit and splice the wires . it works out so much better . quick fix quick headache,68,11
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"quick and easy , but the wires are a little loosehence 1 star loss . otherwise i am happy with it .",20,12
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"did the job , but it was hard to get pair of wires into the contacts and i do not expect this to be a permanent fix , the wires are not securely held and it is not very watertight . good for an emergency repair and reusable for that purpose , but not what i would call a professional or permanent repair .",55,13
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,just what i wanted to replace the original connector which i had ground off when it fell on the ground while i was towing it .,25,14
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,i bought this because i thought this would be better than splicing . it took a large amount of force to push my new trailer plug into an existing vehicle plug and i ended up bending all the pins 90 degrees on my first two attempts . one of the pins broke off shortly thereafter . maybe the pins on this are a little larger then on my vehicles plug . also the 48735 dust covers did not stay on the plug without gluing . looks like i am back to splicing .,85,15
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,i am sure these connectors would work great with newer wire but if your wire has lost it is liability forget these as an option . the wires will not stay after being compressed into the connector . if the wire terminators were a slightly thicker gauge they may work better .,47,16
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"this worked great and was a breeze to install ! i do not see us using it permanently , but for a quick fix , this worked great and seems to be holding up just fine . i may just leave it if it continues to hold up well suspect the wires themselves may be the weakest point .",55,17
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"this kit is exactly what it says it quick fix . i expected this to be more or less an interim or temporary quick fix , however , high enough quality to provide a lasting permanent connection . using the silicon connection protector provided and some good quality tape used zip tape believe this will last for the long haul .",60,18
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"when the weather beats up the old one , i do not have to go and run a new wiring diagram . using the new connector is very simple and easy . through amazon i am thankful for the convenience and the value .",39,19
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"i have gone through two of these pieces . every time i take my trailer out i have to mess with it in order to get it to work . then they fall apart . my current piece fell apart after only three trips out as a result of having to fix it each time i use it . if you do buy this , solder the wire to the metal clips . this is a very poorly made product but it is hard to find a replacement that is of better quality .",87,20
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"i bought a used car in sept 2009 and during the winter or spring of 2010 , i had trouble with the battery holding a charge . i recharged the battery many times during that period trying different methods to rejuvenate the battery until it would only hold a charge for a few days at best . i decided to just invest in a new battery when a friend told me about a battery additive he heard about many years ago . he did not remember the product name so i searched the web and found this product on amazon . i decided to take one more shot to save the battery and ordered this product in may 2010 . i added it to the battery and recharged the battery . the battery held the charge this time but i wanted to wait some time before declaring it a success . as of today , my battery is still going strong and i have had no dead battery situations since adding the charge - it product . this product worked great for me .",167,0
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"folks i can not prove if this product cures the pulsating problem of batteries or not . it is inexpensive enough and has been around since the early days 50s and 60s . who knows only time will tell . i have had better results with tesla chargers i am currently testing with some success on batteries over 20 ah . if a battery is physically damaged , shorted or frozen there is no cure .",70,1
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"this stuff really works . it will extend the life of the battery by dissolving the sulfate build - up in your battery . the build - up of salvation is the number one because of battery failure . i used this in the past when it sold under the brand name vx-6 which is no longer sold . it works in lead acid batteries that can be re - filled . naturally , you can not use it in a sealed battery . this is excellent stuff to totally clean the salvation from the battery terminals too . this will not save a dead battery . i highly recommend this product . my only regret is that i did not buy the one quart size . the some amount . size is good for only one battery . it cost slightly more but you get over twelves times the amount .",131,2
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"i purchased 4 recharge it kits from auto barn one for each battery i needed renewed and it has down the same as a product called vx6 that i had been using for over 20 years . i had been buying it from j.c whitney , but when i checked there website the cost way some amount of money where at auto barn the same packaged product was some amount of money",64,3
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,product did not function as advertised ! there was no voltage improvement after adding this product .,15,4
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"i purchased this stuff 10 years ago and put it in my wifes suburban battery . the battery was a bottom of the line 2 year battery . i saw this sitting on the shelf and thought what the heck , for less than some amount of money at the time i can afford to give it a shot . the same battery still starts that suburban even in freezing weather ! without a doubt , it is the best some amount of money i ever spent on a vehicle . i am about to buy a bottle to put in my golding battery . based on experience i anticipate the battery lasting at least 5 years . it is definitely worth the price !",109,5
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"you use to be able to get this stuff at any parts store , but not anymore . i guess they are trying to sell new batteries . i have saved a number of batteries over the years and with this purchase saved a some amount of money motorcycle battery in about 10 minutes and an overnight charge . this stuff works , period .",54,6
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"this stuff is garbage . first off , they shipped it in a envelope bag what the ? ! ? ! resulting in the inevitable crushing of the package which resulted in it leaking about an ounce out . divided up the leftover amount , placed an equal amount in each cell with a syringe and what do you know , charge after charge later no change . oh well , it did make each cell look very dirty after but 2 weeks later of desulfating and charging there it zero change in the batterysome amountooks like it is just snake oil folks .",92,7
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,i was amazed at how it brought my 6v battery back to life when i thought for sure it was gone !,21,8
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,still waiting to see if battery life extended .,8,9
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,i tried it in two large capacity 48 volt 24 cell solar batteries and was very disappointed,17,10
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"works somewhat on older batteries . , better . , to use in new batteries for longer life . good luck",16,11
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"4 stars for now , easy to put in battery . 5 stars when i leave my lights on , turn off lights , wait oh about 10 minutes , and start your car.this has actualy worked for me.i use it .",32,12
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,it realy works . i would buy it again,8,13
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,put it in my 6 1/2 year old 35 battery last fall . battery is still good in early spring .,19,14
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"this stuff is nearly impossible to find in auto stores and with good reason it works ! why buy a some amount of money battery when you can buy an some amount of money bottle of charge it ? my five year old car battery was not holding a charge . i added a small some amount of money bottle , per the instructions on the package , to my battery reservoirs and the battery has been holding a full charge for nearly a year ! my dad swore by this stuff and now i do too . i wish i would have purchased the some amount bottle for some amount of money just to have on hand for future use with my other cars .",106,15
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,my 2005 truck is still on the original battery . i added this when the truck or battery was new . last time i load tested the battery it was only just starting to weaken so you tell me .,35,16
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,does not live up to the claims battery never charged back up waste of money,14,17
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"battery was sitting for a couple of months . will not hold a charge very well . after adding the bottle and charging the battery all night , there was no change . battery is dead . i guess it was worth a shot ?",38,18
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"if a car battery is old and nearly worn - out , this product can make it good as new for a couple weeks . but then it goes back to being old and worn - out . i always carry a bottle of battery additive in my car , for me or anyone i meet who is having battery trouble . but i tell them to get a new battery within a week . think of it as a temporary fix .",72,19
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,have used this product for years . my batteries have lasted double the regular life . i will always add this . just put it in my new ford max energy hybrid battery .,30,20
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,always use these in my batteries and typically the vehicle batteries last 7 - 9 years . my last car i just got rid of had this solution put in and it is at 9 years of age now which last winter it is now starting to show it is age of a typical battery of 3 - 4 years of use so the new owner is going to replace it before this coming winter .,69,21
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"used to be able to buy this in california but now you can only get online , it work ! i have added it to the battery on my 11 - year - old truck twice , original battery ! still going strong",35,22
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"upon arrival the packaging inside the box was damaged on both items and one item was leaking with corrosion on the bottle that was half empty . as far as how it works will take some time to determine since i put it in a brand new battery . the bottle that was half empty could not be used because it was not enough left to treat a 12 volt battery . if this product works as well as the vx-6 that i used in the past it should make a new battery last twice as long , about 12 years .",97,23
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,may be an instance where the battery was too far gone but did not work for me .,17,24
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,it take a while to see if it works like it is supposed to it was recommended very highly by my brother so i do not think there will be a problem,30,25
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,i used in my battery but it did not work ! . nothing . no single change . well . maybe works for somebody and do not work for other . but for me nothing .,27,26
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,this product has a water base . if you order it when temperature at shipper is below 32 f. it will freeze in the bottle and spill out the contents . suggest ordering in warmer weather . added it and it made my good batteries go dead . charged battery for 9 hours on 10 amps . battery working fine now . update : now the cold weather is here batteries are completely dead . had to buy new batteries . this stuff is a waste of time and money .,81,27
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"i have used this stuff for years an it adds battery life for some reason , have put it in dead batteriessome amounted it for a day or so an then , battery would charge an could work fine .",37,28
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,works as well as the vx-6 additive i had used many years ago . battery has stayed up even in the cold weather .,22,29
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"i have found that it is best to add this in the recommended amounts to new batteries but i have also used it to renew dead batteries with pretty good success nothing cures swollen plates or low voltage for extended periods . i am in florida where most batteries typically last about 3 years , with good ones going lasting just over five . i have used this in two vehicles and had the batteries last more than 7 years . these were in vehicles parked outside and not hooked up to battery maintainers . if you are into chemistry , check out the meds for charge - it and you can work out the reaction .",102,30
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,i installed this product and put battery on slow charge overnight per instructions and it did not improve performance . tried on another battery with same results .,26,31
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,this is good stuff . i have used it before and have always had luck keeping my cars and re travel trailer batteries going for many years . highly recommended for any lead acid or deep cycle battery .,34,32
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"it did not do what we expected it to do . we had used a similar product before but could not find it . so , decided to try this one .",28,33
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"it did bring back some life in the six year old battery , but after a few days the battery could not start the car and i bought a new battery . i will keep a bottle on the shelf and use it when needed and maybe use it in a new battery to extend the life of the battery . it would be wiser to buy the some amount bottle and save then buy the some amount bottle .",76,34
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"on some batteries it works great , some not .had some success with a couple and others nothing but to bring a bead bat back to life it is really the closest option before replacement",33,35
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"i do not think it helped . theory sounded good , but no perceived help for my battery with this stuff . would not buy again .",21,36
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,i had a quart of charge it i bought years ago . i first tried this on a atv battery that the kids kept leaving the key switch on . the battery would run completely down once or twice and i had to buy a new battery . i used the charge it in thisjust battery and they have run it down for the mouth time just recently . so i threw on the charger and up it came again . i believe this additive has saved me at least two atv batteries so far . i have also used it on my wifes car battery . so far she has bottomed out this battery twice . since adding . it is a very old 7years old cheapo battery and i just charge it back up and away it goes . till she leaves the lights on again . i know she bottomed out the battery several times before i put in the additive also but the battery now seems like new . i am sold on this stuff and am ordering another quart .,168,37
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"i received 2 small bottles and have used only one . but have no success yet . i think the car battery was shorted out . that is not a fault of the product , but i can not verify how it works . i will try the second bottle in another battery that i know is still working and can let you know later .",59,38
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this motorola dual charger gets the job done . i previously had a motorola auto charger that had a single micro usb output . it worked pretty well ; however , the cable was not detachable i if you did not have a micro usb input on the device you were trying to charge , you were sunk . this dual charger , which does include a usb to micro usb cable , provides much more flexibility . not only can my wife and i charge our phones at the same time , but we can swap out the cables and , using other cables , charge our daughters nintendo is , and more the charger will top off our phones sassing galaxy sit pretty quickly . it seats securely in the 12 volt outlet and has an led indicator to show the electrical connection with the car is in effect . in all , it is a fine charger . the detachable cable makes it easier to store and gives it the flexibility that many people need given the broad assortment of gadgets in our lives these days . because it has two outlets , it let us those of us swimming in gadgets to keep them charged .",185,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"the feature i think that is best about this charger is that i have verified it has enough current to charge an apple ipad . a lot of these cigarette lighter adapters do not have enough wattage for tabletsbeing useful only for cellphones and other small devices . but on this one , both outlets are putting out enough wattage for the tablet . of course , you can still use it for lower wattage items such as music players , and more one negative is the big box it comes in . it just seems unnecessary to have so much packaging for something so simple . the box is actually around the same size as the box an iphone comes in !",113,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"the jury is out on this charger . the website claims 850ma out of each port but the charger has output : 5v 750ma printed on it . it does not specify whether the 750ma is the total output or the output of each port . since the website is not consistent with what is printed on the charger , i am not sure you can trust the specs at all . the input power claims to be 10 - 33v 1000ma so one would assume to draw that much power over 10 watts , the device should be able to produce 750ma out of each port or 1.5a total 5v 1.5a 7.5w but i did not test it to determine the maximum current output . i may do so at a later time . it did my droid 1 and charge my etc rebound at the same time . the white led is overly bright and you may find it offensive at night , depending on where your cigarette lighter jack is located on your vehicle . i gave this 3 stars because i feel there are better dual chargers available for less and the specs were not consistent with what the website claims . as a side note , this charger includes a micro usb sync cable .",205,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,i like that the cord unplugs from the charger unit to give you a full sized usb on one end and the micro usb on the other . it seems like a well built piece as opposed to some of the more flimsy car chargers . i have got a couple of sophie charging packs and they take the micro usb so it is always handy to have multiple options for charging .,68,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"while this car charger may be more expensive than some of the alternatives you are looking at , it is also better . much better . most usb car chargers provide around 500ma power total , which may or may not even be enough to power your gas depending on which phone you have . most usb dual car chargers split the 500ma power among the two portssome amounteaving them with 250ma each definitely not enough . this unit provides you with 850ma on each port , for a total of 1700ma. i do not think that you will find a better unit in existence . you can charge your matrix at the same time your friend charges his iphone . or any other devices that can charge over usb . all from one cigarette lighter . i highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a car cell phone charger , especially if you may ever need to plug in two smartphones both at the same time .",152,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"the amazon description says this charger is rated for 850ma , but the label on the charger says 750ma. i have no way to measure that , so decide who you want to trust . most car chargers are only 500ma. if you are using your phones gas navigation in your car , 500ma may not be enough to keep the battery from running down . 750ma should be adequate to charge your battery and run the gas navigation at the same time . two sockets is a nice bonus if you are charging two devices at the same time . the charger conveniently comes with a microns cable , which is standard on modern phones other than apple . if you have an apple device , you need to provide your own cable . price on this charger is very expensive compared to 3rd party chargers that claim to do the same thing . should you save your money ? if your motorola smartphone has a some amount of money replacement cost and you are worried about a no - name charger voiding your warranty , then i suppose this motorola charger is worth the price . or you could wait for it to go on sale again .",187,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"for those of us increasingly dependent on our mobile devices , a car charger is very handy . if you are buying a new one , you might as well get a dual - port model for the inevitable time when your passengers device also needs charging . or you get a tablet . or . this unit is a lot bulkier than my old single - port sprint model , but because it protrudes further , it is easier to find in the dark , and i can see the bright led light between the two ports ; the old chargers light would be obscured by the cigarette lighters cover - flap , in my honda civic ex . many chargers seem to not include a cable , so the short microns one included in this kit is very welcome , since i like to keep a cable in each of my travel bags , as well as in each of car or office or home or workplace . a car - charger is very valuable for todays power - hungry short - lived smartphones . this one is a good choice , and handily includes a cable . recommended .",162,6
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,just got a new smartphone and needed a car charger . i was a bit concerned with the price some amount of money compared to other retailers but this was indeed motorola branded on both the charger and the data cable . as stated this item is in bulk packaging so do not expect a retail box .,51,7
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,great works well for any charger . have been using for 2 years now .,13,8
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i have had this charger for years , always has worked great . i especially like the angle it has , keeps the passenger in my cars cable out of the way . having two usb ports for charging in the car is a major plus !",42,9
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,works as intended but charges your phone rather slowly .,9,10

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,best car charger ever ! charges quickly and has added convenience for your passengers as they can charge their phones at the same time . would recommend and buy again . suggest buying a 6 it cable for passengers in the rear that need to charge .,42,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"it is still working . great idea so you can charge more than one device , or so the passenger can navigate while the drivers phone can still be charging .",28,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this charger is excellent ! i bought one for a road trip last fall to keep my android charged while navigating too . gas really sucks up those tons . at our destination the phone was still charged , not dead like the older slow rate charger would have it . both ports are are the fast speed charge ports , this was the important part . it was hard to find one of these that was good for charging two androids rather than one android and one apple product and had a good rating , well heres another . loved this so much i bought one for the wife for my birthday , yes i said for for her for my birthday",114,21
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i love this car charger , he has never left me badly . fast charging and above all does not disturb as it has no wires can be damaged by bending or twisting .",31,22

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this moto dual car charger p617 arrived promptly is exactly as described . it says motorola on it with the hologram everything , so my guess is that it is original , not some knock - off as expressed by some others . it is a charger with dual ports comes with 1 detachable usb wire we micro plug . i am not an electrician , but it says it puts out 850ma per port , which means it will charge most smartphones , cell phones tablets quickly . the home - charger for my moto droid razor i has an output of 850ma also , so it is a good match pretty fast . and at some amount of money instead of some amount of money - some amount of money it is a good deal . it might not work for every cell phone out there like iphone or fit every car lighter perfectly , but nothing will . i recommend it !",137,154

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,i truly like the convenience of the motorola dual charger . it allows you to charge two devices at once . the only drawback is that i sometimes leave it on when i am not charging my phone . i wish the indicator light was on the side where it would be easily viewable . i like the fact that it uses the straight wires instead of the coiled . therefore it is more likely to have a smooth direct charge . no shortage ! i highly recommend this charger to everyone . just hope you are better at remembering to unplug it than me !,96,156

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i love the little white light that this car charger has . i do not know why . totally better than the classic red or green although . my favorite part is the fact that it takes usb cables ! and two of them at that ! this has been really durable for me . it seems like it wil last a long time , i got this like a year ago and still looks and acts brand new . highly recommend !",73,184

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"giving it a five star rating because it is exactly as it is described . the device is good quality , very good construction , will not break , wish they had it with the usb side by side , not on top of each other , might make it a little less footprint . that is being very critical , so i give it five stars because it is a very good product .",65,207

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,a car charger that just does the job . it comes with a cable that can also be used for connecting to a computer . it is nice to have this option instead of just having a charger that can only be used in the car .,43,209
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"bought this based on the reviews . when i received it , part of the body had been clearly sanded to remove some kind of flaw in the plastic so it was all scratched up . yet there was a protective piece of plastic on the front face where the ports are to prevent that from getting damaged . made no sense . the deal breaker for me was that it does not fit snugly into a 12v socket . the metal contacts are tight , but they are only two points of contact so the charger is free to wobble all over the place . most of my other 12v plugs have the two metal contacts and then two other plastic knobs to keep it in from moving around in the socket . returned it .",127,210
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,works great . i got the dual so we could charge one than one phone at a time . real nice not have having to wait in line .,26,211

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,my husband and i usually fight over the car charger but this fixes the problem . consider the placement of the ac adapter although because ours was at a weird angle and tight space so it was hard to have two plugged in at the same time .,46,213
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"had some problems with this on an old phone that would charge slower with this than a no - name some amount of money charger . but after upgrading , my phone is happy with it , and it seems to be providing a good charge , while running efficiently and cool . i will give motorola the benefit of the doubt , but be careful .",54,214
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i am not sure what else i can say about it , it works with one exception . it is a bit too small and does not seem to fit tight in the socket in my vow console . i have to monkey with it to get it to make contact properly . i will add this : it could simply be the design of the power socket in my car rather than this unit , i do not have any other brand to compare so take this with a grain of salt . i do know that my gas plug fits in the socket and works fine .",98,215
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i have a motorola phone so i can not promise all phones will work , but this wil charge my phone from any 12 volt plug in any of the vehicles i have . it is solid and comes with mini usb cord so you are ready to charge . i can recommend it .",50,216

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"just a heads up , i could not get this thing to work with my motorola matrix some amount . it rapid charged fine for my gas galaxy i , and my new nexus 4 . but not the matrix 4g. wish i would have known that ; i swear i saw another review that said it did . tried in all three of my cars honda , vow , ford , and no dice for the matrix some amount . for that reason only , 4 stars ; works great otherwise .",78,226

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is what you want if you need a car charger . so verizon started requiring all the manufacturers leave out the car charger on the docks they offer through big red . i can not explain how painfully and repulsive it is doing business with them . the only car charger verizon offers is the one branded for them . they are so anti customer it is ridiculousness . the motorola car charger is perfect although . it has high output to charge fast i charging cable that comes with it can only be used with this charger , it will not work if you plug into your pa the cable so you can have an mesome amounting cable into that and not have to run another line to your phone , just plug the phone into the dock and it is already connected , big plus and not expected . the charger also offers an auxiliary input for another phone to chargesome amountirlfriend likes very much",156,234

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,seems well made and is able to keep up with power drain during gas navigation and still provide some amount of charging . having 2 usb outlets is helpful as just about everything portable we have uses usb charging now .,39,256

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"the unusual slightly angled design comes in very handy and makes the ports feel sturdy even when two devices are connected . it also allows for proper cable angling in many different setups . so far works flawlessly . the only complaint i had was that the included micro usb cable is a bit on the short side at about 2 feet . i considered it a freebie with it although , so leaving this at 5 stars .",73,259

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i received this charger and immediately put it to use . the kit came with the cigarette outlet - type charger and a 1 - meter usb to micro - usb cable . the charger has two usb outlets , so it can charge two phones simultaneously . works great !",40,261

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this charger allows you to use your car to power or charge just about any electronic device through it is use of a usb cable rather than a specific interface . because of this , you can use this charger to connect to two different devices directly with a usb port or any other power adapter port using a combo cable in the same way you can connect these devices to your computer . for me , that makes this a convenient addition to my car and eliminates the need for carrying multiple different chargers .",90,263
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"solid - built and seems to work well . it is positive aspects are a higher charging current 850 ma , two charging ports , and using a strong and universal usb - to - micro - usb cord . the cord seems more solid than what comes with some other chargers . but , at 36 inches , it might be short for some applications . i also think it is useful that the cord could be replaced if it becomes damaged .",65,264
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i have no problem with the dual car charger part that plugs into car , seems to be good quality , have had no problems with it . but the separate data cable was not what i expected . at first , i thought they sent the wrong cable because the plug did not match my phones etc rebound plug . but after a gentle attempt it plugged in to the phone and the phone was charging . because the plug is not exact and the cable is also very stiff , it is loose at the connection to the phone , purchasers should just be careful moving the phone or the wire while it is charging or they might damage the phones charging port .",116,265
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"my husband and i bought smartphones , and these phones need to be charged much more often than regular cell phones , so i bought this car charger . it works well . plug one end into the car charger and one end into the phone . i have a sassing galaxy nexus , and my husband has a la lucid . it works for both brands of phones .",62,266
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i have bought other rapid car chargers but my droid razors phone battery would still drain under heavy use , such as navigation streaming music bright screen . i can finally say a charger exists that will still charge my phones battery no matter what i put it through . and that is even when i use the second usb port on it to power a bluetooth adapter ! definitely recommend .",67,267
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,i have not noticed any charging issues with this charger and my droid razor maxx . it seems to charge even when navigation . my only issue is that the wire is so stiff but i would think that a stiffer wire also means higher quality and a larger path for juice to flow so maybe to get ther amount of power needed the wire needs to be a bit thik,68,268
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"usb charging is apparently very hard to get right , and motorola succeeded . this charges my sprint or etc evo some amount at ac rates , and i recently tested it with my wifes iphone 4s at the same time . i am very pleased with this .",40,269
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,just starting to use . new charger feels well built and seems to be performing as described . will be using extensively soon . will report back if performance falters . is : performed great on road trip . no complaints whatsoever .,33,270
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,so far the charger works great . it is very convenient that it has two usb ports . the indicator light is non disturbing .,21,271
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"what i wanted what was what was pictured , a plug with a second usb pugin port . the description said dual . what i got was a cigaret plug with a single attached cable and micro usb on the other end , but no place to plug in any other usb cables .",49,272
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,i purchased two of these assuming that with the motorola name they would be very solid and good quality . i was very wrong . within three months both broke and i threw them away .,33,273
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"i use this charger for travel , and it is great . i can carry the usb cable with me as i need it with my laptop , then use it in the car as needed . well built .",35,274
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"although this is officially a motorola charger , and arrives with the motorola hologram to prove it , i am currently using one usb port to charge my iphone 4s , and the other port to charge my kindle fire . now granted , neither port is the 2.1 ma that the kindle fire requires , but the micro usb data cable is the correct connection , and the motorola charger works slowly , but perfectly . my iphone 4s is right at home on the other usb port , charging with reasonable speed . for the family with multiple phones , this charger is the perfect solution . most phones and small electronics have a usb - based charging cable that be added or substituted , at about two dollars each . i have got cables labeled iphone , kindle , lg8000 .",122,275
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is a great charger . you can plug two usb cables in it . it is very compact , barely larger than a 1 - cable charger . another useful thing is that you can plug whatever cable you want as long as one end is standard usb . in my case , i can charge one android device and one iphone , and use the right cable for each . not bad at all !",66,276
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"the usb charger does the job . we have charged numerous devices from mp3 players to iphones . the charger does not have enough power to charge a ipad but otherwise had no problems . it is a little bulkier than most chargers but if you need to charge 2 devices at one time then it is worth the extra bulk . so far it works well and have had no problems . it is much better quality than the cheap chargers and similar in quality to a welkin , and more",85,277
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is a well built dual usb slot charger . i did not have any problems using it to charge two devices at the same time . it charges fairly quickly as well in addition to being compact . overall it is a great , versatile charger .",41,278
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is one of the best car chargers i have used thus far . granted , i have always purchased the cheap chinese car chargers , but stillthis is one solidly built charger . it came well packaged in a motorola box , and included a micro usb cable . the charger has successfully charged two droid incredibles , two sansa mp3 players , and several other friends iphones . the charge seems pretty fast , and the charger does not get hot unlike so many others . no annoying lights are emitted to distract you while driving at night . all in all , the best car charger i have seen !",99,279
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is a nice dual usb car charger , and it does indeed work great for charging phones , ipods , and small electronic devices . it does not , however , provide sufficient amperage for charging an ipad . granted it is not marketed specifically aimed at ipad , but as a dual , universal usb charger , i wish it provided a bit more oomph .",57,280
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"there are other car chargers that can be purchased for cheaper , but the bonus of this one is the feature that allows 2 devices to charge at the same time . also this is an official motorola charger that is recommended for those devices as opposed to a generic charger . due to the fact that it does provide the option to charge 2 devices at once it is somewhat on the large size . however it is not so big that it hinders it is use . it comes with a micro usb cable along with the charger . i used it to charge my phone and my mp3 player cable included fit my phone , i had the usb cable that fit my mp3 player and simply plugged them both in . they both charged quickly during the car trip i was on . simply , this device works very well . if you are someone who has multiple devices that you would like to charge at the same time or need a motorola specific charger then this device fills those needs perfectly .",174,281
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"it is easy to review this product . it just works ! there are two usb outlets , and they provide one micro usb cable . so you can utilize one for charging your phone , and one other for whatever purpose you wish some amount . if you are traveling , charging the camera . pricing is on the high side . you can find single chargers for much less . a dual usb charger like this is essential if you have only one outlet and it has to do double duty . if you have multiple electrical outlets available , then you are likely better off buying two separate off - brand chargers .",97,282
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is a good charger for the car ; it has dual ports , an unobtrusive power on light , and comes with a very nice cable for micro - usb devices . pro : dual ports means one can charge two devices provided one has a cable for the second devicethe charger only comes with one cable . attractive design , with sturdy construction . the power on light is not overly bright , just right so as to be obvious but not blinding . a nice , strong usb cable is included , which is long enough for car use some devices only come with a few inches of length . con : not really a con , but the output is rated at 750ma , which means it will not charge any of the newer high power tablets like the ipad or my dell streak 7 both require 2000ma to charge . it will run my s7 , but not charge it . summary : nice choice if one needs the usb power for two devices . highly recommended .",161,283
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"disclaimer : although this was given to me through vine to review , unlike other questionable reviewers , i actually take the time to use the product or read the book . so whatever score or review the product gets , it is absolutely earned . at no time is a product given a particular review or rating simply because i fear loosing vine status . that is not how the vine program operates . anyhow , onto the review : ok . not much to say here , but i will give a brief synopsis . this thing is built very well and even came in a motorola box . the p617 , with a higher amp output definitely makes a difference in charge time . i also have the moto spn5400a microns charger and not unexpectedly , the p617 appears to charge just as fast as the spn5400a. compared to my sprint branded charger it charged my he touched in rough half the time on a trip to north carolina . also , as expected , when using both usb ports simultaneously , the current capacity is split between the two and charge time is less . the well - built motorola p617 works exactly as it should and it is excellent build quality should permit many years of charging . recommended .",193,284

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"stunningly effective gopher trap . there has a learning curve . but it is quick . watch a youtube video or two , and you will be off to the races . seldom will this trap be set not snag a varmint . having thrown every trick in the book at my garden vermin . this is the first one that reliably makes gophers disappear .",56,1
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"do not waste your money on these traps , the gopher fills the hole with dirt , and plugs up the trap . buy a cinch trap , they work great .",26,2
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,it works ! i can now launch a new campaign of extermination against the pocket gophers ruining my gardens . after setting this trap the next day i was rewarded with a dead gopher devil . onward and upward . i am extremely pleased . the trap is well made and appears to be good for many more uses . love it !,55,3
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i bought a couple of different traps to try and these by far the the best ! so easy to use and set up . good complete kill every time . highly recommend !,30,4
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,have not caught anything . added the food pellet and it still did not attract them,13,5
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,these look like they would work really well good videos on youtube explaining how to position them but where i live the soil is extremely dry and very powderyalmost like flours it is difficult to get the thing positioned properly in the gopher hole since the tunnel just collapses as you try to dig down to place the trap .,61,6
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"got it today , set it and less than 2 hours later i caught one . i have no idea how many are living in my lawn but hopefully this product will bring their reign of destruction to an end . i feel kinda bad but . not as bad when they mess up my nice lawn . poison was not an option , i have two pets and they would have found a broken discarded chunk .",68,7
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"for a wimpy girl this trap is a lifesaver , or i should say a flowerbed saver . i caught a gopher in less than an hour on my first try .",29,8
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,did not catch the gopher . the gopher kept filling it up with dirt .,12,9
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,seemed like a good product but i did not catch the gopher with it .,13,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,before this black hole trap i have been using black box trap which i like but when i miss the gopher the trap is filled with dirt . my theory is that the tunnel needs to be a little longer so the gopher thinks he has to push the dirt a little further . this trap is a little longer and does that . so far i have 4 kills in 5 trap sets . my guess on black box trap is a percentage success . when it gets filled with dirt you just have to keep following hole back and resetting trap . this has a flexible wire snare and black box is stiff . easier to remove gopher from black box but this black hole is probably a better design . i am buying more of these today,131,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,these are absolute killer for pocket gophers . i caught 9 in two weeks . for pocket gophers you need to make the hole in the end of the trap larger so it incites them into the trap better .,37,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,had very little success with this . went back to the old spring traps and had a lot more luck . too big and bulky to use without destroying your yard .,29,13
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"bought this trap and actually caught one gopher . then they wised up and started digging around it . plus , i was making as much or more of a mess digging up the yard than the critters . so i splurged on the yard butler , bought some strychnine coated bait , and it is no muss , no fuss . and no gophers .",56,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this thing does not fit into the hole and has to be propped up in the upper part of the gopher hole where they do not want to go . have not caught a single one yet , needed to change back to the mccaffey so ? trap that fits down in their holes and traps them .",51,15
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,got the gopher with this contraption so i have to give it a 5 . we had it in our back yard for a very long time and finally decided to purchase this product and give it a try .,38,16
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have been using these traps for 20 years and am convinced they are the best in the market ! gophers frequently try to backfill trapsbut with the full cylinder havesome amountophers seem they have a harder time to push the trap away , or up . i just bought two more of these to retire my black box style traps . those do not work for me .",64,17
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i would actually give this trap a 4.0 rating but this is the only way i could send a note to all the 1.0 users . alice chop 1 got it right ; the trigger mechanism is a main because the trap fails to release the snare . for me it is always 1 of 2 reasons : 1 aluminum trigger pin is angled to put too much force or drag on or in plastic trigger set hole and or or 2 there are traces of sand in trigger hole and or or aluminum pin causing trigger pin to jam instead of freely sliding free so releasing trap snare . once you know this it is easy to test trigger release by lightly pushing on plastic trigger inside trap cylinder . once convinced trigger pin is sliding freely leave set , position in tunnel , being confident if gopher enters trap to plug it will be caught .",141,18
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,these traps are very good at getting rid of gophers . highly recommend them,13,19
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,this is awesome ! i caught some amountophers in 2 days ! no more problems .,13,20
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,tried it and can not get it to work . instructions could be better . never caught anything after three tries i gave up and went back to poison worms,27,21
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"these traps require too much digging and even then there is so much foreign material many critters are put off and just pack it full of dirt . i have had much better results with the little wire trapssome amounting sweeney , or better the gophinator although they do not seem to be available on amazon .",53,22
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"these are by far the best thing i have ever used for getting rid of my pocket gopher problem . i watched an entire iris plant get pulled down into a gopher den and i had enough of the destructive beggars . i bought 4 traps . in 6 days of having traps set , i have eliminated some amountophers . they are showing no signs of activity in my wifes flower beds any more . we have many more to battle on our property , but they are waning . highly recommend these traps .",87,23
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,trap is not sensitive . adjusting the trigger to the most possible sensitive setting and i had to push the screwdriver with force to set it off . instructions says slight bending may be necessary however that also does not work . it seems like a bad design to have metal rod insert into plastic trigger which just does not slide well to set off the trap . the trigger should also be metal . the rodent does not have enough force to set off the trap . i may have gotten a defective unit but still do not like that the trigger is plastic .,98,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"caught the guy destroying my new lawn within a few hours . i simply dug out the fresh dirt to expose one of their holes , armed the trap and shoved it in . a couple hours later i glanced at the trap from inside my house and could tell it was set off . i yanked the trap out and there it was , the ^ that destroyed my lawn we had installed a few weeks ago .",73,25
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"based on the reviews in amazon , i bought this product . unfortunately this product does not work for my gopher problem in my backyard . i read the instruction coming with the product and watched quite a few youtube clips on how to use this product before i set it up in the backyard . i set up the black hole trap at newly dug mounds . each time i followed the instruction , but each time the gopher pushed the dirt into the trap which set it off . after about a dozen of tries , i finally gave up . here are two possibilities that the trap does not work : 1 . if the gopher has been exposed to traps before , it might develop a sharper sense of danger . it might pushed dirt into the trap instead of going inside to check the source of light . i live in a large residential area with backyard fences . the gopher might have experienced something similar in my neighbors backyard . 2 . according to some online readings and other reviewssome amountophers in northern california tend to be smaller and are harder to be caught by black hole gopher trap . hope you find my disappointing gopher hunting helpful of your purchase decision .",200,26
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"thought it was a good idea but the voles laughed when i put it in the ground , it is hard to fool a vole .",23,27
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"wow , i wanted to believe the other reviews . gophers are demons , they are lawn anti - christs , they are the spawn of devils ! when i saw the black hole , i knew i had to at least give it a try . placed it as close as i could tell into one of the more recent holes , covered it with tiresome amounteaving the light hole open and stomped on all the other holes hoping the little monster would take the easy way out . i placed the trap in late afternoon . looked out the window the next morning to see that the spring was now in the unset position . could it be ? had the demon seen the light and his little gopher brain told him to go towards the light ? yes ! success , one dead gopher ! i bagged and trashed that one and then locked and loaded the trap again , in case his demon spawn were still crawling around . many thanks to the creators of this trap , your a percentage guarantee has me a percentage satisfied !",168,28
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,it iis very difficult to set the trap .,8,29
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"bought this thing and caught a gopher within a day . no joke . i have caught three with this so far . i do notice that sometimes the gopher will fill it with dirt . or at least what i suspect to be a gopher . it could also be a ground squirrel , as my cat caught one of those too . long story short , it works . quickly .",62,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"save your money , this did not do anything , the trap would never go off even after following the instructions to soften the curve on the latch . three times found it filled with dirt still loaded and kicked out of hole .",39,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,buy the black box . it is the only one that worked for me,12,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i had tried about 10 different methods . i ordered this last year . the first time i set it i got the mole ! this year another mole showed up i set the trap and got it the first time ray olympia wa,41,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the jury is still out . we have been trying without success for just under 2 weeks . tried both moles and pocket gophers . tried without bait and with bait . tried with an open hole and with a covered hole . tried with dirt inside and without . tried it level and on a slant . most instances the result was a trap filled with dirt . sometimes it resulted in an empty trap but the tunnel sealed off . the only reason i did not give it one star is that it is easy to set . continuing with the assumption of a learning curve but not optimistic at this point .,102,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,bought this to use for squirrels who have decided to take up residence in my roof . there is a little hole in the back i put peanut butter in and the squirrel chewed through the hole overnight to get to the peanut butter rather than go through the open or trap side . pesky little twerp ! so i covered the now gigantic hole with duct tape and placed the peanut butter on the trigger this time and voila ! squirrel 1me 1 . game over !,82,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,yes bought this years ago before getting on the market and the only way i can catch gophers . love it !,20,36

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"once i got the hang of using these i have trapped several gophers . a trick that worked for me is to fill bottom of trap with soil so that no plastic is evident on floor of trap . the wire noose should be hidden inside trap and behind front lip of trap . i leave the small hole in the back of the trap open . if you trap a gopher , dispose of that gopher , then reset the trap and put it back into same tunnel system . you will likely catch another gopher in another day or two without having to dig more . these also seem safer to have around pets than other traps . my only complaint is these are larger than other traps so require digging out a bigger hole to seat them properly against gopher tunnel . however i decided not to take off any stars for the traps being large since these traps do the job well .",156,43
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this guy helped me with chipmunks . those little folks could not be trapped with anything else , i have tried more humane approaches , but ended up with this as a last resort . first , i put food inside i or o having it charged to let them get used to it , then i got them all snapped within next few days . sorry to see it worked out this way , do not like killing animals at all , but i can not see what they have done to my lawn .",79,44

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i do not write too many reviews , but if you are anything like i was then i hope this helps . i live in a court , the gophers have been bouncing back ruining all 4 of our yards for over a year . we tried flushing them out , to no avail . one neighbor went with the electronic noise stakes , another with poison pellets . neither did anything . the last straw broke when i was walking across my lawn to check a sprinkle and a huge portion sunk in under my feet . i live in ca and it is hard to have a nice yard while being water restricted . there was no way i was losing my yard to this gopher ! i searched online high and low , reading every review until i found this black hole gopher trap . do not take my word ! look at the pics people attached . they truly work . i would definitely recommend buying 2 and putting them back to back . my amazon package was here wednesdaysome amountopher caught thursday . thank you for your product ! will proudly recommend to everyone with pest problems .",180,51
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this is an excellent product . we had a major gopher problem and , prior to purchasing this , we tried gopher poison . we had very little success with poison but , with this trap , we have caught several gophers . minor downside is pretty unpleasant to get the dead gopher out of the trap . wish they had constructed it such that i could release the gopher without having to touch it gross even with gloves on !",74,52
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i purchased two of these products , and they both performed poorly for their intend use . i found them difficult to activate with a stick , and moderate to heavy force . none of the traps have activated , even after being physically moved out of place by the animal . the trigger , even when balanced on the edge of activation , is too difficult to trip .",61,53
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"did not catch any gophers , but works great for catching rats . best if you tie it down to a heavy base and block access to the rear hole .",27,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i bought two traps , caught 1 pocket gopher somehow , but since then the gophers keep burying the trap . i used the black boxes before but i buried those and lost track of where i buried them , i think i will order two more of the other ones . i am not sure , but i think the opening might not be big enough for my gophers so they just pack the trap with dirt instead . but hey , at least i caught some amountopher .",79,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,used as directed and it caught a gopher within 15 minutes .,11,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this gopher trap was super easy to set and worked perfectly . the day i received it i opened it , found a fresh mound of dirt and exposed the gopher tunnel and set the trap . i put a little of the dirt inside the trap so it seemed like part of the hole . out of curiosity i checked the trap about 30 minutes later and it had already sprung with the gopher caught ! 30 mins ! if you have a gopher problem this trap is about as easy as it gets to solve your problem .",93,57
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works great . 4 moles in 2 days . you got to have a couple of these .,14,58
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i am catching gophers left and right now . if you get it at the right angle and cover up the end he . bam . you will get yours , too !",25,59
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"works great . i have gophers doing destructive things . i was recommended this trap , and it is worked great . i am following the instructions and so far it is worked each time quickly . as soon as i see loose dirt , i find the hole with a shovel , set the trap and within 30 minutes the pest is removed . so far clean kills as well , i just depress spring and cable and rodent falls out . was a little worried about blood and guts as the cable and spring are strong , the gophers i am getting are coming out clean and completely dead .",96,60
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,wow ! the first was in just 4 hours . everytime has worked like magic .,13,61
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,when i asked my husband on a scale of 1 to 5 . how many stars would he give this . he said seven . he has used it twice and caught a gopher each time .,30,62
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,got this trap at the local hardware store and their version is called gonzo but it looks exactly the same . set the trap in the afternoon and noticed it had already caught a gopher within 6 hours .,37,63
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works great . go two the first day . i put some dirt on the bottom . had to dig the hole bigger so it would fit .,24,64
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i had something digging tunnels in the yard . i tried many different things to get rid of it . this finally did the trick and caught the gopher that was ruining my yard .,32,65
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,they are great i have used them in the past and they still work great . easiest way to get rid of them,22,66
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,fantastic ! gopher caught that same day ! everyone needs one of these who has gopher problems .,15,67
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have caught some amountophers with this trap using peanut butter . can not say much else , it works ! however , you have to bury this at the entrance of a gopher hole by digging down to ensure the trap is in line with their tract system . it takes a bit of effort but the payoff of a saved yard is well worth it !",62,68
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,ok i was not sure about this trap but my nephew who works at a golf course said these were the best for killing moles and gophers . took me two days and some moving around of the trap but bingo got his butt !,43,69
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"one gopher in first 24 hours . waiting too see if i have any more gophers . easy to set . nothing can move out of place to disable trap after it is set . dig your hole , place trap , cover with dirt . the spring kicks up right although the dirt . i also baited with small piece of carrot .",55,70
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the wife gets great results . when she forgets to check them before dark , the scavengers take off with them because half the body is usually stuck inside . needs a cable and stake or screw auger",35,71
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this bad boy works like a champ . i did have to add a wire and ground stake to it because if you forget to check that trap that next day , some unknown animal takes the trap and gopher to devour it at a different unknown location .",46,72
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"awesome trap ! i have recurring issues with gophers and moles as my home backs up to open space . i used it on my hillside where it has been difficult to successfully place other traps . this one worked first time , eliminating a very large gopher that was causing a lot of damage and eluding other traps . contrary to the reviewer who said that it did not deliver a quick kill , mine dispatched the rodent cleanly and quickly the first time . i love this trap and could not ask for a better performance . this was money well spent !",95,73
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"works for me almost every time . find a good lateral burrow , set the trap in place one facing each direction and pow . if i get a good set , i nail them .",31,74
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,needed a few more of these as the gophers are taking over this learnt so much any more ! black holes are the best traps we have foundquite reliable and easy set up / clean up .,39,75
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"1st day in hand . found gopher canal , set trap placed in hole . added some moss around trap plus some dirt to close in sides around trap . next day pocket gopher doa . tried poison . did not work . i highly recommend this trap .",41,76
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i tried bait and ultrasonic generators with no luck . i picked up the trap at a local hardware store and when i saw an open tunnel i dug up the end and planted it . the trap was easy to set and place .,42,77
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the best invention ever . caught 5 of them after wasting hundreds on stupid chemicals and smokes from home depot and loves . that is a complete waste of time , this things works like it should . highly recommended",38,78
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,these are the only traps that really work for us,10,79
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"a percentage best gopher trap i have had ! owned it two days and caught two gophers i have been after with standard traps for week and just got buried . takes zero time at all expose tunnel place seal light around it with dirt . check in an hour and done with these pain in the ass pest ! buy it ! set it ! ask questions later ! been trapping gophers in az for 3 years and by far the easiest , most effective trap i have used !",87,80
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i purchased the black hole gopher trap and have successfully eliminated some amountophers from my garden and heard area . poisons did not work for some reason . these traps are easy to set and easy to release the dead gopher . without touching the dead animal .,44,81
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,takes some work to set properly but i am hopeful .,10,82
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i tried several times with bait and without bait . the voles that i have just dig around it . other traps that i have worked much better . i recommend not to buy .,31,83
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"it looked like it should work but it did not . i tried every orientation , but it only got packed full of dirt and pushed out of the hole .",27,84
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i will begin by saying that we live on 9 acres that used to be a hayfield . every summer or fall the gophers and miles start to go crazy in our yard . despite the fact that we use an old fashioned trap , it was not enough to catch the little buggers . my husband was complaining that he needed another trap so he could set both sides of the tunnel . i read reviews and ultimately decided on this one . it arrived and we were convinced we would catch one right away ! nope . he set it twice . the darn thing set the trap off but it did not trap it . finally on day 3 we caught it . in a months time , we have now caught 12 . my husband has perfected his gopher catching skills and i could not be any prouder",135,85
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,did not work for me . i followed instructions and it did not work,13,86
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"some amountophers down . when will the war be over ? trap is still a percentage functional , highly recommend for a humane way to remove pests . more humane that poisoning or explosives",29,87
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,best gopher trap ever . bought others but nothing worked until this one .,12,88
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,probably ineffective if used alone as a gopher deterrent strategy .,10,89
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the moles just when around or under it,8,90
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"great product ! i bought one 20 years ago and it is a fantastic gopher trap . still using made old one , but want another one because it was sooo hard to locate a new one . it is very effective !",37,91
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,got a gopher in 15 minutes ! worked great !,8,92
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have caught a few pocket gophers with these traps , but they are overly large . you have to put a large hold in the ground ! normally , you have to put two traps in the ground , one facing each direction , because you do not know which direction the little bugger is coming from . that gets to be very pricey with these traps ! i have gone back to the victor style traps exclusively .",68,93
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"works very well , we have gotten many many gophers with this trap . if i have any concerned it is that the piece of metal at the top can bend a little too much and has to be re - aligned , but that is not too much of a hassle considering how you have to set the thing . would recommend .",55,94
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the traps work great if you have the knowledge on how to use them . i went my first week getting skunked . i was putting them in old gopher holes , not fresh ones . i tried 2 new gopher holes and have been 2 for 2 ! downside is gophers are ugly as he shall and i had to look at em . update : a few weeks later and i have eradicated all the gophers in my lawn .",72,95
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"only product that works for me . we have a huge gopher problem but whenever i see a new mound , i go grab this . just make sure that you really dig out the hole , enlarge the tunnel and try to get this to lay as flat as possible . whenever i have been lazy and did not want to take the time to really dig it out properly and flat , i have not caught them . yes , you have to dig out your grass a bit more but the gopher will because much more damage in the long run .",93,96
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,trap did not work . i checked it twice after leaving it under the ground for weeks at a time . good news is is that i have not seen any gopher holes in quite a long time . trap is easy to set up .,42,97
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,best gopher trap on the market . easy to set in works much more efficiently than the regular steel gopher traps partially because the gopher is halfway into the trap before he realizes that he has in one . thinking that the whole on the other side is the end of his tunnel . i have had gophers who have avoided the steel traps 4 days get caught in this one within a day . would definitely recommend,73,98
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have tried others but this one worked the best . probably trapped a dozen so far .,15,99
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i challenge the designer to try to set this trap by following the instructions .,14,100
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,took some learning time to make it work . had to set it as sensitive and used peanut butter .,18,101
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have tried many ways to kill the pesky and destructive pocket gophers . this thing is perfectly designed and i was able to wipe out the population in my lawn and garden . 7 dead pocket gophers so far this year . be sure to buy two so you can trap both sides of a tunnel at once and not guess which side they will come from .,64,102
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"after trying every means to get rid of gophers without killing them i had to step up to something like this . this little box is the only thing that has worked for me . after dealing with gophers for the last 5 months i was able to trap some amountophers in 48 hours you can not beat that . just find a new spot where dirt is pushed up fresh , dig a small hole in the tunnel , i used a little dab of peanut butter inside the trap , set it , cover with loose dirt , and check periodically throughout the day . one gopher did get trapped and not killed so i did have to kill it myself . do yourself a favor and save your landscape and money by just starting with one of these if you have a gopher problem .",136,103
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have used several different types of gopher traps . this trap has a a percentage success rate for gophers . this is the trap to buy if you want to keep it simple . thank you,34,104
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have a gopher issue in my neighborhood , when they started digging into my basement crawlspace i knew i had to deal with it . my dachshunds dig up their holes , even sometimes the runs , so i can put a pair of traps in exactly the right place . the only issue with this trap that i have had is that it has never had a successful kill . the gophers have dug around it and filled it with dirt ; something about the shape seems to make them suspicious . i have another trap that is square shaped and it has killed some amountophers and one squirrel . i feel sorry for the squirrel , he must have just been curious . the trap caught his foot with the upper arm , then when i let the dachshunds out they killed him . the dachshunds also killed one gopher on their own , caught him right at an exit hole where he must have been caught unaware . so the trap itself is fine , seems to be in working order , i just have not had the success others have had with this style of trap .",184,105
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have a lot of experience trapping gophers on a small farm . i have given this trap a couple months and have yet to get a single gopher in it while my standard sweeney traps catch dozens . not recommend,38,106
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"trap works well , but sometimes the moles outsmart us .",9,107
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"so far the gopher has outsmarted this devise , not sure if the trigger is too tight , really set the trigger as light as i could and the critter still won out . resorted to poison bait in front of the trap and he filled the trap most likely after eating the bait . the bait worked . the trap . well it is in the bucket waiting to see if i can get it to work on another one . i have used these in the past with some success , but after setting this trap a half a dozen times with only getting it filled up with dirt by the gopher he is either very smart thinking caddyshack here or this trap is not working very well .",120,108
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"every year we get a few gophers tearing up our garden or yard . this trap takes care of them . the tricky thing about this trap is the placement . place it wrong , and the gopher will backfill it with dirt . you have to make the trap an extension of the gophers tunnel . it can be tricky doing this near plants or sidewalks , it is better to find a hole away from those things . get the trap in the right angle , and you will catch your gopher .",81,109
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i got one of these after the gopher tripped my cinch trap twice , but did not get caught . with this trap , i dug out the hole a little bit and placed the trap at an angle so the air hole was facing up . i covered the top of the trap with loose dirt and waited . a couple hours later , the gopher was caught dead in the trap . this trap is easier and so far , better than the cinch traps i was using . highly recommended .",83,110
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,this takes out gophers amazingly well . we use two of them on our ranch . highly recommend .,17,111
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,two catches in first three sets . one failure was on me as i assumed incorrectly the direction of travel of the gopher . will recommend to others .,26,112
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,do not buy this trap . i can not set . the hole in the black holder is not big enough . there are much better traps .,24,113
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"works quickly and effectively . trap can be used at the end of a run or inserted into the middle of a run . cut a clean edge to the gopher run and butt the trap up to it . seal any gaps and cover the trap with loose tiresome amounteaving the air hole open at the end as well and not impeding the trigger mechanism . i work some dirt all over the trap when they are new and put some loose dirt in the trap too when putting it in place . bait it with a few slivers of carrot peel up the run a foot or so , and then more in the back of the trap , gophers have a keen sense of smell . it is a little difficult to extract the wire from gopher , but worth the effort on this very effective trap .",140,114
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this is the first gopher trap or bait that i have tried over the years that consistently works . i am three for three this spring and it is easy to set compared to other traps . the trick is to probe with a thin stick or wire to find the tunnel , then dig it out , insert the trap on a 45 degree angle and use the loose dirt to cover any sunlight , except for the hole at the top of the trap . best to set as soon as you see a new mound but i caught a gopher in an older mound , four days after i set it !",102,115
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the black hole gopher trap is the one that i have had most sucess with to trap pocket gophers or moles as they are called in our area . it is simple to use and very effective .,36,116

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,this thing is easier to use than it seems . i did not think it would work and i was skeptical on how to utilize and implement it . howeversome amountuess what it did work !,32,118
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"if you have gophers you need this trap . my dad has over an acre of land and the gophers were running ramped . we tried all sorts of things that we heard about from firecrackers to smoking , but nothing seemed to work . i came along this trap and figured , what could it hurt ? so it turns out this trap is amazing ! i got my dad two different shaped traps . one round , this one , and one square . i did not care for the square trap , even although it worked , it was awkward because of the square shape . this trap , which is round , was much easier to work with and best of all it works ! once i put the trap out , within a couple hours i had a gopher . this works like a charm ! i had to purchase more so i could place multiples around the yard and not have to keep using one . it truly is a great trap !",156,119
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,too large for the gopher holes in northern california . instructions also require putting dirt into the trap hole .,18,120

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"a gopher was tearing up the front yard . i ordered this black hole and followed a you tube video of how to set it up . the next morning i saw it was sprung and pulled out the trap . i caught the gopher , so success there ! then i had to do the gruesome deed of finishing off the animal . it was not dead . next , i tried the trap several times trying to catch the gopher in my garden . the garden gopher must be a little clever since the trap was sprung on two different occasions but no gopher inside . so for me this product is a mixed bag , success and the agony of defeat !",112,122
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,for older people this is hard to use . it also requires some real experience to make it work right and position it properly . the main problem is that i expected something that would at least work a little differently as i am concerned at how well it works .,48,123
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i love these things . i have probably caught hundreds of gophers in the past 10 years using these gopher traps . it is a simple and effective design . occasionally i loose one when i leave it too long , and a dog raccoon , skunk , or other glitter finds it with a dead gopher before i do .",54,124

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"fantastic trap ! i thought i had a mole problem , but started thinking it was gophers . the standard scissor trap was not working , so i opted to buy the black hole trap . within 12 hours i caught my first pocket gopherthe trap is excellent is works for both gophers and moles . the best thing about this trap is the ease of installing it , not much thinking involved in how to set it .",73,146
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,if i could give it zero stars i would have . as an experienced and successfull varmint trapper i should have known better just by looking at it . this trap is junk . the mole eliminator trap 1001 has proven to be the best .,42,147
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"perhaps my particular trap is defective , but this trap has an extremely stiff trigger . it would take a gopher on steroids to trip it , and the opening is too small for the gophers around here . i have both the black box and the macabre traps and have no trouble setting a hair trigger with them and have caught many a gopher using them . i thought this trap would be an improvement , what a waste of money ! glad some people are catching gophers using them .",84,148
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,caught a gopher first time i set it yea !,9,149
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,this trap worked within 2 hours of setting it,9,150
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"great product , some amountophers and counting , i tried every way not to kill them , but they are just out of control",21,151
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,if you getting down in the hole put a little dirt inside it and then cover it back up it work like a charm . we have caught some amountophers with one trap .,32,152
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,great out of the box . the first 3 sets and caught some amountophers . my only complaint is that i had to straighten the latching piece because it was bending . over all i am very glad to have purchased this item .,40,153
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i bought three traps , dug up three gopher mounds that afternoon and set the traps . next morning i had three gophers !",21,154
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have used these traps before , to catch gophers , it either kills them instantly or traps them where they can not move . after you catch the first you have to start out smarting them . they learn quick",35,155
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"heres what i wrote a while back : i trapped some amountophers last year and 10 already this year ! this trap is great . heres my latest view : with my old traps , i had great success and bought traps for friends and neighbors . i bought two for my friend with 5 acres and he got 100 . overall i have bought about 15 of these traps and loved them . but , the latest ones have caught zero gophers and my neighbors have the same problem . it seems the trigger mechanism or trap quality has gone down . so , i went back to my old traps and immediately caught some amountophers .",105,156
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have dozens of gophers in my yard , but have yet to catch one with this or any other trap . i could not tell which direction to point this trap in the tunnel and ended up digging up a lot of my lawn trying to install it . may try again to see if i have better luck .",57,157
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"woohoo ! i just got the 2 traps i ordered in today . was going to put off setting them because it is 100 degress outside , but decided i could not put it off . i set them up after watching this video : i went inside anxiously and did the dishes , the whole time staring out my kitchen window wondering if i caught one . ran outside 10 - 15 minutes later and a gopher was caught and killed quickly . no wiggle wiggle like i have experienced with mice and mice traps . easy clean up . no bloodstone amounts or gore . just pinched down the spring bar and it fell into the dumpster . i reset the trap and about to go check it again . seriously although , watch the video , it gives some good tips !",124,158
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"do not waste your money . i had high hopes for this one because of the design , but had with no luck at all . the design seems really good , and it is easy to set . i just wish it worked . i bought the dk-1 gopher traps and got some amountophers within the first 3 hours .",52,159
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have trapped many moles with this design of trap . and this was a very good price for the unit .,20,160
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have used this to catch dozens of gophers and moles . i like it because it is easy to set and easy to see if you have caught one . afterwards , you lift the trap out of the ground and can dispose of the dead critter without having to touch it just push down on the spring lever and give it a shake . hard to find in brick and mortar stores , but came in the mail in a few days for a great price .",81,161
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works great on my pocket gophers . usually tripped within 3 - 4 his of setting .,13,162
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,we opted for a sonar stick i or i the vole population was getting out of control . this is good but we have no desire to clean out the traps,28,163
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,a percentage success rate ! the best gopher trap we have found .,9,164
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i live in the vole capital of the world and this is the only trap that consistently catches voles and pocket gophers .,22,165
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i caught some amountophers in a row in one week . i am surprised that my backyard has so many gophers . i cut open the back so the whole trap looks like a big pipe to expose the light better . i dig the gopher hole to make it big enough to cover the front of the trap . then i inserted few baby carrots in the trigger divider . so far this is better than any other traps i have used .,78,166
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the new traps are made a little heavier than the older ones i have used for years . the stronger springs probably kill gophers a little more quickly , but they require more fine tuning to trip correctly .",36,167
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"works great . my first one broke after many years and many dead gophers . i found that if a gopher is packing dirt into the trap , that you either need to dig deeper into the tunnel , or i put a strawberry into the peek hole at the end of the trap . cover the trap lightly with dirt then cover the trap with a garbage can lid to keep light out . also try and set the trap so it is level and not angled up . i do not know how many gophers i trapped with this thing but like i said , it worked so good that this is my second trap . i have a pet so i can not use poison . using this trap you can see the dead gophers when you catch them . to get rid of the gopher , push the trap wire back down , shake it out of the trap and bury it back in the hole as a warning to the other gophers not to come by anymore ! you do not have to touch the dead gopher . i sometimes it does get a little stuck , although",183,168
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have been in a constant war with gophers every year . i have tried poison , smoke bombs , other traps , and more this is the best trap i have found to get them . when the gophers start digging air pocket holes , you have to dig them out and find the main tunnel , placing this trap in the main tunnelsome amountuessing which way you believe the gopher is at , in about a day if you have placed it right the trap will get them . i also bait the traps in the end with the left over poison that i have found ineffective in killing them , but it does attract them to the trap ! i have gained new confidence in being able to maintain a garden without it getting destroyed thanks to this trap ! this trap is especially great if you have dogs or little kids in the yard because if the trap goes off it will not hurt them .",155,169
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have spent more than an hour trying to set this trap to no available ,",14,170
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"these are not only great because they catch rodents of unusual size , but they also give you the opportunity to leave said rodents in places you would not expect to find one . that is in the toilet , on the dash of a car , in a shoe , in the cats litter box .",48,171
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the black hole gopher traps are excellent . they are the best way to get rid of the gophers . i highly recommend and will continue to purchase them . unfortunately , the last batch that i received were defective . i returned and was promptly credited . excellent customer service .",45,172

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have about at a percentage success rate . i love this thing , only drawback is you have to dig a fairly good size hole to put it in and if you were using this in your yard it could be a bit of a problem . me , i use it in the garden and orchard where those nasty critters because me the most problem . typically if it is a tended yard the voles seem to be less interested and also that is why we have four cats . they also do a good job but are a lot more work !",97,175
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"like a giant mouse trap , my husband calls me the gopher hunter laughing out loud !",13,176
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,did the job . gophers are gone for now . purchased after neighbor recommended . fairly easy too use .,16,177
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this product is effective , and does what it says it does , but you have to dig the hole out and bury it in the ground . i will keep it for future use , but the most effective and easiest solution i found was actually another product called the gopherhawk",49,178
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have not caught any moles as our moles are very transient between our yards and the neighbors yards . i think they are wintering at the neighbors to the left of us . it was easy to set up and easy to install in the hole . you just have to get the right hole . however they are not lawnmower safe . i lost one to my son when he was mowing the lawn . he did not know where it was buried and did not see it poking up .,83,179
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,did not catch one gopher in over a month . moved it and did what it said in the limited instructions . the gophers are still tearing up my yard .,28,180
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,excellent . got all those varmints that were destroying my yard !,10,181
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works well to trap pocket gophers . we bought two as sometimes there are situations requiring a trap to cover both directions of the tunnel .,24,182
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,do not know what i would do without these traps . i have a pasture for my horses and these traps really work very well . gophers march in to my pasture and then die .,32,183
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works well as long as you get it buried in the hole correctly and leave air space at the end .,20,184
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"we have pocket gophers , and they have created a mess of our gardens , and they like to fill and bury my sprinkler valve boxesjust completely packed with dirt . i first used an pest control guy , and i watched what he did . i then searched for traps , found this one , and it works very well . i have trapped 3 in the past week . when i see a fresh mound of dirt , i dig to find the tunnel , place a trap at the opening of the tunnel and i bait it with a couple of cashews . i then place a large plywood board over the area keeps my terriers from helping and wait a few days . once trapped , the vermin is easy to remove .",123,185

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"caught some amountophers in my yard in about 3 weeks . works great . highly recommend . once that new gopher dirt shows up on the surface of the yard , just dig down to find the tunnel and make a horizontal area for this trap to snuggle against the tunnel hole . put some dirt around the trap to seal it up to the tunnel . caught most of mine within 24 hours of setting the trap .",73,187
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the trap has not caught any moles yet . i am sure that it is because the traps are so pretty , they do not want to mess up the inside of the trap up .",31,188
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"less than two hours after placing the black hole gopher trap in the tunnel , one gopher caught . i have been fighting gophers for many years and this is the best way i have found to stop gophers . highly recommend this product .",41,189
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have tried numerous gadgets to rid my 2.5 acre property of voles . this is the first true working system . in one month i have caught 44 voles . remember to wear gloves when setting the traps !,34,190
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i purchased two new traps as my old ones are showing some age . i am disappointed that the new traps have a cheap flimsy plastic trigger . i do not know why they had to cheapen up something that was almost perfect . i will not buy any more until i am sure they are the old style with the metal trigger wire .,57,191
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,bought this as a gift . recipient really happy .,8,192
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"make sure you leave the back hole open without dirt , they will go in and try to fill the back with dirt",22,193
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,excellent for squirrels . bait with peanut butter and bird seeds . tape over hole in back to prevent squirrels from gnawing to get into other end . anchor to prevent other predators from hauling away your catch . purchased 5 of these .,39,194
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works very well . has helped keep gophers under control . much more predictable than other traps i have used .,18,195
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i bought three traps and caught three gophers on the first try . they are easy to use , but you have to be sure the wire remains free or the gophers can fill them with dirt without springing the trap on themselves . i feel this was a very good purchase .",49,196

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"long story short , i went from the very bad water hose idea to smoke bombs and poison . i was about to hire an exterminator or apply the time proven shotgun remedy after losing somewhere in the area of 25 plants , however , i still had the option of traps . i ordered this one and a very similar named competitor but the score is 30 with the black hole winning . i did run into a trap smart gopher but he got caught on the fourth or so tripping in 15 minutes . usually i do not review products , but this is one of those rare products that works as advertised and does not cost a fortune .",113,198
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"pocket gophers make it almost impossible to garden here on the western its . next to nation forest . if one is not eternally vigilant one may as well not bother planting anything , that includes edibles , perennials and trees . with over 35yrs into this fight , i have tried any trap that might do the job . the black hole for some reason outperform , the common wood box type and the black box which is the molded plastic version of the wooden box . in - tunnel pinch - types are too wide for the tunnels here . the black hole seems to work better than the others because : it does not light - leak , the end hole is larger what the gopher perceives as the end of the tunnel , the trigger is located differently , is shaped differently and can be set to be very sensitive requiring less pressure to activate , the round interior loosely mimics the gopher tunnel , the round shape is easier to locate snuggly at the tunnel entrance and lastly , there are no big hardware holes that allow cover dirt to fall in and alert the gopher . these are all best guesses based on observation , but it clearly outperform the other types",193,199
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"we were over run with pocket gophers last year , but after using these traps consistently , we do not have a gopher problem anymore ! take a little time to learn how to use them correctly and you will trap the gopher every time . whenever i see a fresh mound , i find the tunnel , excavate it a little to fit the trap tightly to the opening of the tunnel , tuck in a little dirt around the edges so the hole in the end of the trap is the only light the gopher sees , and within hours i have trapped the little bugger . no more damage to crops , irrigation ditches , and more i highly recommend this trap over those that fit in the tunnel or have an open bottom . i have tried all three and i find this one works much better and is easier and safer to use . just do not put your fingers inside while you are setting the trap . when you catch the metal hook into the hole in the plastic trip piece , try to set it as lightly as possible , only catching a little of the plastic in the hook so it will be like a hair trigger . great product !",196,200
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,we loved the black hole because it works . much to our surprise waking up this morning the black hole is no where to be found . someone had an easy meal and we have to order another backhoe . .,38,201
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,love it ! it killed a huge gopher within 25 mins of me seeing it dig a hole and me putting it on top of the hole . can not wait for the next gopher to pop up .,35,202
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i hate voles when they dig into my yard . i have tried odor units , water , smoke and compression traps . the black hole is by far the most effective i have used .",31,203
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"ground squirrels no . chipmunks / flying squirrels yes , not strong enough for the bigger critters . could have more tension on spring .",21,204
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"works really well for squirrels . quick , quiet , very humane . just two things to consider . 1 because it is round . it requires some bracing to keep it from rolling on flat ground . anything that will keep it from rolling works . a small tree branch , some dirt , a rock . 2 there is a bait hole in the back . tape over the hole in the back . use clear tape so that the critter sees light at the other end . pour bait in from the front . otherwise the squirrels will attack the bait from the rear and trigger the trap . very effective overall . buying tip : search many store pages for the right price . some stores have grossly over priced this item .",117,205

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the perfect trap for catching gophers and easy to dispose of the rodent when they are caught . my friend gave me the first one and i am happy she introduced me to it .,33,208
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,at the same time i used these traps i also used several victor the black box gopher trap 0625 . the black box traps caught about 20 pocket gophers . the black hole traps would just get buried . it seems the hole was too small for pocket gophers so i tried it on ground moles but it did not work for them either . the cinch traps worked on several occasions also where i had problems with the black box .,76,209
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"as noted by others here , this trap does work but the spring - and - wire - loop system is not strong enough to kill all gophers outright , sometimes leaving the final coup de grace to you . the victor black box gopher trap has worked consistently well for me .",43,210
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,it did not work for us . we try in different spots and we have not catch any mole at all,20,211
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i recommend to ones who have problem with gopher to buy one of this . very useful device for catching gopher .,20,212
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this seems to be a fairly well - made trap . we still have not caught our gopher - enemy with it , but the design is clearly better than the standard galvanized metal pincers .",28,213

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this trap came highly recommended as the best way to trap moles . we bought 4 and set them up all over the yard . it has been months , have not caught a single one . we decided to have someone else find and set the traps for us thinking we were doing it incorrectly , but no luck . maybe it is not the trap and we just have really clever moles .",66,215
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have one . my neighbor has a victor the black box gopher trap 0625 . she loaned me hers . i will compare both models . snap on the victor the black box gopher trap 0625 is more forceful and seems to kill the gopher more quickly gophers seem to prefer walking on the ground , not through this tube easier to set the victor the black box gopher trap 0625 as it can sit on the ground level . with this model you have to hollow out the dirt to insure it does not roll . this is nice but the victor the black box gopher trap 0625 is better . i recently bought two victor the black box gopher traps and prefer them .",116,216
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"after spending hundreds of dollars on poisonssome amountases , deterrents and more i finally have found the solution to my gopher problem . these traps are fantastic and i caught both of my gophers within 36 hours .",34,217

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works great ! i have already caught two gophers . just leave in the hole over night and by the morning the gopher was caught .,23,220
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i followed the instructions to catch some ground squirrels but had no luck with this trap . even after setting it for many days and use of recommended baits the chippy is too smart to get caught .,36,221
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,quickly caught some critter who then walked off with the trap connected to the critter somehow . had it down in the opening of a ground squirrel hole .,27,222
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i had used this trap 15 or so years ago and could not find it when i moved back to the country . i tried some others in the meantime and could not handle the gore of the most effective one . i was delighted to see this on amazon . i had caught two gophers within 5 hours of receiving the trap . i can empty it almost pretending i am not working with a dead rodent . a local red tailed hawk looks for my catch every day as i put it in the meadow next door and keep the food chain moving .,99,223

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have owned three of these traps and they are just straight gopher killers . i attached a little flag to the tripwire to let me know when they are set off . it usually is within an hour after being set that a gopher has being dispatched . since i have owned these two traps about a week i they have killed some amountophers with modest effort and about a a percentage effective kill ratio to false trips . the gophers have to close the open hole to prevent predators from getting to them and that is how the trap is so effective is because they are put into a catch 22 . they will die if they leave it open and they will die if they fill it . it goes to the base instinct of the gopher to it is own demise . great product . i have owned one for over 8 years and still killing !,148,225
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i placed the trap in the ground and within one hour i had one nice big gopher trapped . it did not kill it instantly but it still works great .,28,226
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i read all the reviews before buying but when the trap arrived i doubted it would work because the gophers are bigger than this trap . the gophers pack it full of dirt and go on about their business . disappointed . because nothing seems to work that i have tried .,49,227
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"after trying juicy fruit i was skeptical but desperate , smoke sticks , and more , a friend showed me this . i set it late one evening , then woke up to find a gopher the next morning . so i set it that evening , too . before dusk , i already caught another one ! set again , strike again ! after 3 days of use , i have eliminated some amountophers and counting . these things are amazing ! they are definitely worth the money .",72,228
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this is a good product , but not recommended for sandy soil . the gophers simply push sand in to the trap , tripping it . i have caught gophers with it but not in the sandy parts .",34,229
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i tried two other gopher traps but the springs were so hard to set i had to return them . then a friend told me about the black hole and how easy it was to set so i ordered two . he was absolutely correct . even i could set them . within 30 days i caught some amountophers !,55,230
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"very carefully followed all the instructions , even did some research on gophers so i understood them and how to locate their main tunnels which is where you want to set the trap , not their air hole tunnels . absolutely a bust . tried several places , even baited with garlic although that supposedly was not necessary . save your money , do not buy this thing .",60,231
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i did not trap a gopher , but they left anyway . it must have scared them away . maybe they will not come back .",20,232

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"worked well for us , not so well for the pocket bothersome amounts of bitching by his family . recommend it , yes",20,234
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have caught some amountophers with the small steel trap , but i have had no luck with this black hole . maybe i am not using it correctly , but if that is the case why do i catch them with the other traps ? it is the same concept , just put it in the hole .",50,235
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i had a black hole several years ago but it went missing think i loaned it to a neighbor . this one has too much plastic which can break . it is not as sturdy as the old one . it catches the gophers very well and it is easy for me to use .,48,236
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,several times i put bait in it and several times the trap was tripped but nothing was in it . it just sits empty now . i will be returning it .,29,237
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,we definitely have gophers in the yard because we see them running . but it has been over 6 weeks and still no catch .,22,238
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the black hole trap is very easy to use , and it works better than any other trap i have used .",20,239
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"two days three gophers . does not that say it all ! make sure to set it lightly , prime the bottom with dirt . do not touch anything with your hands gloves only . a little bait never hurtscitrus leaf ? rose petal ? tempt em .",40,240
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,we have reset it in several places and have not caught a gopher yet but the cats caught 1 . cats 1 trap 0 .,21,241
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,have used it before and works most of the time . i now have 3 black holes now . that is because i have many gophers . my score for this year is some amountophers and am working on 6,37,242
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,we live on a few acressome amounts of moles and gophers . a neighbor has this trap for his lawn and vegetable garden areas . it was working so well for him that we bought 2 to try them out . they work great ! will be ordering more of them !,47,243
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the only thing that worked in my garden . easy to use . through the dead moles out and make the magpies happy .,21,244
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,this contraption is the only thing i could find that actually works . it is my last resort and i do not think i need to spend money on anything else again !,30,245
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have used the black hole gopher traps for the past 20 years and had to purchase a new trap recently because i misplaced the previous trap . the black hole works ! i caught some amountophers in 6 days ! i read recently to place a carrot soaked in olive oil in the hole at the rear of the trap . do not laugh . it worked !,62,246
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"we bought 2 of these after trying several other cinch traps to no avail . the moles are ruining the yard and are digging tunnels all over . after reading the reviews and being frustrated , we set these up end to end to get them coming in from both sides . after one night , both traps were still open , not activated , but the varmints had covered both of them with dirt . this is exactly what had happened when we set the cinch traps as well . placing them deep into the holes , covered with black plastic and a bucket to keep all light out . traps sitting there , not activated but buried in soil . we even tried the poison peanuts , but seems like they are dining and dashing . what are we doing wrong ? have lost our sense of humor as well as money .",138,247
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the trap requires some hand strength so be extremely careful . other than that is is easy to set and works just as it says . i call this and the second trap we bought the decapitates . it is kind of sick but when you can not get to these guys . this one needs a larger hole to fit into so be prepared to dig and block out the light . if you follow the directions you will succeed .,74,248
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,phenomenal . caught the varmint within 24 hours . this is definitely a device that worked for me compared to all the other methods i and others tried .,26,249
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"have tried all the traps out there and this one has just the right shape , opening , that captures and kills .",20,250
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i have used the product 3 times and got some amountophers . for the present , my property is gopher free ! thanks for a great product .",24,251
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"caught one first try , the second gopher from he shall has buried it three times or back filled it . i finally used chlorine and ammonia in a probed hole . think i finally got it .",33,252
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this trap catches mice moles rats i gophers . i use a small carrot chunk as bait . works . i also put a some amountallon bucket over the area to completely block the light . with a brick or two on it . had these traps once , they disappeared . thank you amazon for offering them .",51,253
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the product is easy to set up . it is strong and sturdy . we have caught many between two neighbors . i recommend it . i will buy even more for the beginning of next season .,32,254
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"this trap is great , easy to install , the second time i installed pum did his job , and had tried all kinds of things to catch the gopher , once trapped is removed easily , is a great invention .",36,255
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i purchased two of the black hole traps and they work very well . the only issue i have with them is the spring tension is lacking in strength . when the trap is triggered and it captures the offer it does not apply enough pressure to kill them instantly and they sit in the trap and fight to get out of it until they either die of suffocation or i finish them off myself . i hate to see any animal suffer and for that reason i switched to the black box traps . they are similar in the way they work like the black hole . except their spring rate is a lot stronger and do the job instantly . i personally would recommend the black box over the black hole . thanks for reading .,129,256
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,does not function animals do not trip trap . product cheaply made trap trip settings to stiff to trip when animal enters trap .,22,257
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,i have tried various gopher traps and have limited success with each of them . i tried these hoping for increased results . the bad thing about these is the diameter of the size hole needed to put them in . i think if they reduced the diameter size by a percentage they would be more effective . i have often found that i can not get them in the tunnels because the trap is so big . my success with these is about the same as other traps i have been using over the years .,86,258
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,yes these traps work and yes i have caught several gophers . the problem is the quality . i purchased these 8 to 12 weeks ago and the springs have now punched out the back . 1 trap is no longer useable . disappointing,39,259
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,wow ! i ordered this trap and when it arrived i had a fresh gopher opening . set it according to the instructions and less than 3 minutes later i heard it snap and had my gopher . i know it was lucky but less than 3 minutes is amazing . nicely built trap so i am sure i will use it many times .,60,260
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"hi there , read the great reviews , bought the trap , did not catch the gopher . we have tried everything and the furry little creature still evades us as he eats his way through our yard . we have moved the trap to fresh mounds morning and night , we have tried moistening the soil around the mound hole to simulate rain this is supposed to get the gopher to come up to ground level , my husband is really good at anything he does and even he is stumped . it is definitely a gopher , not a mole , because the cheeky little devil popped up to have a look at us ! we do not know what we are doing wrong , we have followed all of the instruction , but the trap is not catching him . would not buy this product again .",128,261
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,it is not the best . i have caught two gophers in two weeks . i have to admit that it is the only trap of three that i purchased that caught any gophers .,29,262
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the black hole gopher trap is the best underground critter trap i have used . it is easy to place in the ground and quite effective at capturing the varmints . i have many voles and they have been difficult to trap with other devices . the black hole misses about 1 out of 8 and that is only because they sometimes push enough dirt ahead to trigger the trap before the victim is inside . i have tried the wire spring traps , poison smoke , car exhaust via a hose adapter and none are as effective as the black hole .",96,263
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"i love these traps , would not use anything else . these get the critters a percentage of the time . i have tried lots of devices , these are the best !",26,264
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"i really like melissa doug products . these trains are cute and my son really likes them . the are on the larger side and the magnets do not hold them together as the smaller trains my son has . despite this , i like them and would recommend .",45,0
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"while impressive aesthetically , the graphics on the engine are not printed straight . what has really frustrating for my 3 - yo boy is that magnetic couplers are very weak compared to wooden thomas , tru imaginarium resulting in train breaking up . after few days i eventually removed these engines from his train table . 2013 update - doug and melissa customer service sent replacement engines . the replacements carry the exact same serial numbers and suffer from the same problemvery weak coupler magnets . our other my trains do not suffer from this defect .",89,1
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"we love melissa doug products , but i was very disappointed in this one . the train looks great , and is very sturdy , but it is just too long , and even a bit too wide to fit our tracks mostly by maxim , with a few melissa doug pieces . i really wanted to keep this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter , but testing showed it would just be too frustrating . your mileage may vary , but the length of each engine means they definitely can not handle the short curved pieces , and the wheel width even made it rub on many of the maxim straight pieces . i also got her this other similarly sized my engine : i freight train , and works just fine .",121,2
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,i ordered this set with melissa doug big train set . they are way longer than regular trains so my boy had a bit of hard time to keep them in curved track because of their length . i wish i had bought something else from melissa doug,48,3
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,i bought this for my 2 year old grandson for his birthday . he and his older brother already have a vast collection of thomas the tank . my son pointed out how he likes melissa doug better because they look more like real trains . my two grandsons were having a grandsire pulling around his trains with the engines . they fit perfectly with their thomas the tank wooden trains . i liked them so much i ordered some more melissa doug trains just because . they are well made and cute . the trains also have two wheel trucks on the bottom so they can go around curved track so easily . i was very impressed with the quality .,115,4
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,my daughter - in - law requested that we buy this type of toy because it is very well made . my grandson has enjoyed playing with it . it arrived in great condition and in a timely manner .,33,5
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,my son loves these two locos . they look very close to the real locomotives operated by pacific national rail on the australian rail network .,24,6
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"the product was not new , package opened when arrived .",9,7
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,this was a gift for my grandson . it is quality build and connects with the other train pieces he has . he loves it .,23,8
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,too hard for my 2 year old to keep on his track . this train does not take turns well and often tips over . my son has dubbed it the bad train and only plays with it when he wants to wreck his train track set .,44,9
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,it matched what was on the bridge box perfectly . one happy boy,12,10
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"as someone who is rediscovering bro and other wooden trains , i find it nice to have somewhat prototypical locomotives that are compatible with bro and other track and trains . for the price , i bought 4 sets from another vendor . amazon has the same price , but i got a little less shipping charge at the other place . nice looking and worth every penny . i will check out other melissa and doug trains .",71,11
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,our son loves these locomotives . we like their detailing and that they fit on our existing wooden and plastic tracks . the magnets are strong and the wheels turn flawlessly .,29,12
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,larger size for little hands . heavier than the smaller trains so it moves along track and down hills smoothly . kiddo like because it resembles a real locomotive .,27,13
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,my son has many melissa doug trains the paint on these trains holds up pretty well these trains seem to be very well made,24,14
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"nice set of trains , not thomas but very durable and little grandson can crash them and we are not worried of them breaking'me amounted purchase",24,15
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,i bought these for my three year old grandson so he can play with them at our home when he visits . he loves trains and they keep him occupied for hours on end . he loves them .,36,16
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"these were for my grand - nephew , and he enjoyed them immensely . i thought they would be a little larger , although , for the price",22,17
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"the kids love the engines , what little boy does not like trains . they play with them all the time and have hours of fun with them .",25,18
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,these fit fine on our thomas track and are actually bigger than i thought they'd be . they are perfect for little toddler hands and the magnets are good and strong .,30,19
Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"i found these looking for christmas presents for my son who is 2 1/2 and loves trains . these are perfect . the fact that they hook up magnetically and that they are such a simple , sturdy construction makes them perfect for my toddler son . they are so creatively painted and yet the design does not have all these small plastic parts that can be swallowed . i will be buying several more sets of these for him to add to his collection . these are awesome and really a good price for the value .",90,20
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"dice definitely do not hold up to the displayed amazon picture . there is no shine to the dice you will receive . average dice , nothing special",25,0
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"these dice are nice , but not quite as eye catching as the picture shows them to be . also , i was disappointed to notice as soon as i started playing with them a bit , the white in the numbers began to rub away . these do not seem super durable but they serve the purpose . what should you expect from plastic ?",59,1
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,i liked the color mix . copper steel looks really good for this kind of thing .,15,2
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,they do not give me as many natural 20s as i would like . but they are good dice haha,19,3

Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"i am in love with these dice ! they are so beautiful . the colors are so much more amazing in person . they are a bit weighted towards 14 , but nothing major . these are my first dice and i am so glad i got them .",40,12
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"well , they look great and they roll fair . what more could i say ? i got them because they looked like rusted iron .",22,13
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"i am comfortable with the heft , ratio of colour , shine however , hue of colour is definitely not as pictured . the colouring is gold no matter how you look at it , not copper . very frustrating .",33,14

Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"sharp , clean edges with a nice weight . the numbers are extremely easy to read . if there is a downside , it is that i am doing and i am killing my players with all high rolls and natural 20s .",35,37
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"my go to set ! it is gorgeous , very easily read , and rolls very nicely . the set i had received has more steel than copper . the edges are sharper than some of my other sets rounded edges . very similar to the feel and weight of the cheeses scarab royal blue with gold numbers . this is my second favorite set .",57,38
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"the dice seem to be molded from good plastic , and the colors are pleasing , the numbers distinct enough to be easily made out .",23,39

Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"these dice are very brilliant looking , just as pictured . however they tend to roll low numbers a lot and got my priest into very bad situations . i had to place them in time - out and use other dice for awhile . beware !",40,41
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"my friend wanted these so much when he saw my set that he would not rest until i told him where to get them . they were still an option , even after ten years or so since i bought mine . very gratifying .",40,42
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"i love the look of these dice . despite the color splits the focus of the gemini name , the colors themselves look great and , when they do mix , mix well . the thing is although , my set roll really low . when i was rolling these for fun , i consistently rolled ones . at least 3 in a row , when it would suddenly roll an 18 or 20 . it may just be my roll although .",72,43
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,excellent team for playing do not disturb with the steampunk look is great when playing the steampunk version would definitely but again .,20,44

Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"started playing roles games with the kids , they ordered this set for their role playing , everyone is pleased as expected .",20,47
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"i do like the dice in the picture , but i did not fall in love with them when i saw them in person . there was a lot more of the copper coloring than the steel so it made them look weird , but they are still awesome dice . they are a great collection to any gamer or dice collector . they are a really great price and they arrived on time and all , not any issues . even although the coloring is not my favorite , it is still a great set .",83,48
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"you can never really tell what you will really think about dice from pictures . sometimes they look great in pictures , but not as good in person . and vice versa . i bought these to give them a try and for a different color i since i needed a lot of different kinds of dice for a new game i am playing i and while i thought they looked okay in their pictures , i can not describe how much i love them in person . it is kind of funny . i always used to laugh at my gamer friends who have favorite dice and love them so much that they will not even let you touch them . but now i understand ! i get so excited to roll these babies . copper - steel . who would have thought ? laughing out loud .",127,49
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"fun to use and great quality . picking a set of dice is all about the looks and i like these a lot , one of my favorites .",26,50
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"for the price , they are certainly worth it . i think they are gorgeous , although depending on the individual dice , the swirl can make the numbers hard to read from across the table . please note that i am also as blind as a bat . i have been playing with them for a few months now , and the white numbering is starting to wear off a little bit . there is an indent where the number is should if it gets bad enough , i could go in with some acrylic paint to fix it . overall , i would recommend this set .",96,51
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"i do not know if i am unlucky or something but these dice are pretty bad . the picture shown is not exactly accurate as the ones i got had more gray than anything . not even silver , it is gray . i would have been fine with that if the copper had a presence , but it does not . besides the d4 , the rest of the dice have little to no copper on it . my friends thought the copper on the d20 were little ketchup stains . the percent die looked like it was supposed to have more copper because it had lines that hinted at a swirl pattern but the entire thing is gray . overall , these dice are not what i thought they were , but then again , maybe i was one of the unlucky ones that got the dice that barely made it through the coloring process or something",140,52
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,he like it . it is good dices . feel light but great . it is too hard to gift wrapping it although .,20,53
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,they are a decent set of dice . rolls are pretty random . only knocked it down a star because my set had all the dice 70 - a percentage silver . all of them barely had any orange on them .,35,54
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,the copper and steel look on these dice have a real steampunk feel to them . the ones i got have plenty of variety in the patterns . the d8 has a percentage steel with bits of copper swirled in . the rest are a half i half mixture .,46,55
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,can not say much about how precisely random they are but they are not obviously biased and they are gorgeous . i have gotten compliments on them .,23,56
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"these dice are sexy . they looked just like the image picture . i got them as a gift for one of my new players that just got started playing do and pathfinder . still i almost regret not getting them for myself , they look really nice .",44,57
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"i love these dice ! they are gorgeous . sadly , the d6 from this set turned out to be entirely the steel gray with no copper swirling , but i know that the coloration is random and that is not really the fault of the product . the gray does not really have the same luster as the copper so the poor little d6 is terribly boring looking . all the other dice are gorgeously marbled .",68,58
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"ah , dice . can not play your favorite tabletop rig without them . this set is very nice looking but much like other diesels it does not bring anything new . it is a nice looking nicest at the same price as others . numbers are easy to read and it is extremely well balanced . i will say although i have only rolled one or two crits with these so these dice are good but i fear they might be bad luck for me . take that as you will .",82,59
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,these look great in person . very bright colors easy to read numbers . i like that the edges are not as rounded as others . now if my do would just stop rolling constant 20s .,33,60
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"bought this for my kids who started playing do often enough with me they needed their own set , dice has a nice solid feel , strikes well and at least for my kids rolled high numbers more often it seemed",40,61
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,i really like this dice set . it is exactly as pictured and also comes in a plastic dice box . the only small detail i would change is the white on the dice is chipped . it is barely noticeable but when i buy something new it would be nice to chip the paint myself . i would buy these again . they work perfectly for my magic the gathering playing .,65,62
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,i got this set because orange is my favorite color and they are beatiful ! they are like the picture and have sharpe edges too . this is also my first set of dice . they are wonderful !,35,63
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"i rolled natural 20s every time with these . . but really the dice are great nice blend of colors , and the numbers are big enough to quickly and accurately read the dice .",32,64
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"the colors were and still are bright and true to the photo here . they have a nice shine to them as well . these dice feel very nice in hand . i have bought several sets of these , in different colors , and they all have held up very well .",47,65
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,i ordered a few set of dice for a friend at christmas and i was temped to keep these for myself even although i have no personal use for them . the pictures really do not do them justice and they really look like metal . i would recommend them for sure !,49,66
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"my only complaint is that the edges are not sharp , but they are still recognizable . that being said , i have seen much sharper edged dice .",23,67
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"inexpensive , not to use the word cheap , but i did not spend a lot on these and they are worth about what i paid . functional , but if you want something better you will have to pay more which is how it should work .",42,68
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,got 10 sets of these in varying color combinations for my wednesday night gaming group as christmas presents . everyone loved them !,21,69
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,gets a 5 star . very cute police dress up costumesome amountreat quality . and fun accessories . thank you very much for a great product .,23,0
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,cute . came very quickly and everything there . my son enjoyed being a police officer . he was loving it for halloween .,20,1
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,this was a cute costume for my 10 year old . fit great . belt is very cheap but otherwise very nice .,20,2
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"i bought this for halloween for my 6 year old . there were a few slight issues . he broke the handcuffs within 3 days but of course they are plastic ones , the belt it comes with is kinda cheesy . it does not stay tight and it about 3 feet long . i trimmed it and stitched it up in a few places to make it work a little better . also , the costume was a little big for him . i had to do a lot of taking in on both the shirt and the pants . but , with a little work we got it to fit good and it was a cute halloween costume . he wears it every now and then for dress up and throws me in jail !",122,3
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"i was pleased that the pants and shirt are made of a thick , durable material . something that can definitely stand up to a 7 year old boy ! my son loves the costume and has worn it numerous times before halloween already . we have even had to wash it and it came out looking great delicates cycle and line - dried .",56,4
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,the costume it is self is cute and will be played with for awhile . the duty belt is a one day use and the handcuffs are to be looked at and not used . of course the handcuffs are what kids want to play with and is this items biggest let down .,50,5
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"i bought this as a christmas gift for my nephew . he absolutely loved it ! the handcuffs were broken within 5 minutes , but it is still worth the price compared to other costumes that i looked at .",35,6
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,very large for my four year old who wears 4 i pants . the pants are very very long .,17,7
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"purchased as a birthday gift for my little guy . he loves it ! it looks authentic , does not wrinkle when tossed in the dress up box , and is better quality than your average costume . the pants are a little long , but nothing that can not be easily hemmed . so far we have just rolled them up . he is a growing boy after all .",59,8
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,bought an small and the pants are as tall as my sons entire body luckily it is a play costume but we cut off about 12 inches and still need to have them hemmed,33,9
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,we got this as a gift for one of our nephews . he loved it ! his smile on his face . it engulfs him as a 4 year old but he will grow in to it and be able to have it for the next few years . seems well made . note the provided cuffs are plastic and super cheap looking . i doubt those will last but the outfit is sure to be fun for a good long while .,76,10
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,my son is 7 year old and and is a husky boy . this costume was perfect . love the material well made . i ordered large because he is a little chunky . he is 49 and weighs some amounts . the size was perfect for him . i would definitely recommend it .,48,11
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,good quality costume . fit my husky 6 year old pants were a bit long . worked great for furture career day at school .,22,12
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,great costume . seemed to run a bit small . i would order a larger size than the child needs .,17,13
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,this product was perfect for my 8 - year old nephew who wants to be a cop . the accessories work nicely no sticking on the handcuffs and the outfit is made of nice quality material .,34,14
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"the costume has included with it a short , pants , belt , handcuff and badge . the belt was essentially useless as it was very large i cut it down to size and does not really have a latch or clasp of some type to keep it held in place . we pinned it to his pants because he wanted the look . over all , the fabric seems to have held up well . after halloween we washed it in tha machine although the label says to hand wash and it has held up to the occasional dress up day .",93,15
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"the pants were larger than the shirt , but it all fit well enough that our great grandson could wear it .",20,16
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"i love the band . it looks great , attached to my fit bit just fine . the size i ordered was just a bit big for my wrist , so i do not wear it as often as i would like . would order another like this in a smaller size next time .",47,17
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"it did the job . my son wore it for a school parade 1 hour and trick - or - treating for about 2 hours . he is a tall 6 year old and the pants were about 4 inches to long . easy to hem although . mediocre quality , but fine for the price and for just halloween use .",51,18
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,i love this costume . so cute and fit well . the hat is a bit flimsy .,15,19
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"i liked the costume . my kids loved it . the pants were quite a bit longer than i had expected and i went by his typical pant size but it was still too long . the shirt fit well although . although the larger size , 10 - 12 , fit perfectly on my 9 year old who wears a size 10 in jeans . so i guess it is just iffy on whether it will actually fit true to size or not . very thin material , which is typical of any costume . the handcuffs are your typical cheap plastic cuffs that easily break . i did , however , buy a separate badge that looked more authentic that hangs around the neck but the one it comes with works fine for what it is purpose is . the hat , however , although i thought was cute never ended up getting worn . very flimsy hat just mainly material with no shape or form to it . both of my boys hated the hat but the costume is still cute without it .",163,20
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my son loved this . the badge kept falling off , so i glued some velcro on it . the belt needed to be paper clipped to stay on . spot clean only , i think the lettering may wash off . hand cuffs are plastic , bought a different pair to go with the uniform . sun glasses not included !",53,21
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,fit perfectly ! good quality for a halloween costume,8,22
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,the costume fit just right and the material is of good quality .,12,23
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"the product description said this was a cotton costume . the product i received was a percentage polyester , yuk !",17,24
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,cute costume but it runs big and the toy accessories are cheap and fragile . my son was disappointed that the billy club was not included . i guess i missed that in the product description,33,25
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"this is fantastic ! i bought this last year for a christmas present for my son 6 and oh my word , my son loves it ! he wears it all the time , and brings it with him to dress up when he visits his grandma , and he loves pretending to be a police officer .",52,26
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,got this for a friend for her nephew . it fits perfectly . the quality is good .,15,27
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my grandson whom i purchased this costume for absolutely loves the outfit , the handcuffs however broke almost immediately as they are cheap plastic . fortunately he had a better pair before he got the costume , uncle purchased a nice pair of handcuffs to go with the outfit and extra keys .",49,28
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"fun costume , made for great material . prefect for childs play",10,29
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"super cute costume . pants were a bit big , but did not look bad once the outfit was all put together . just a little weird in sizing when comparing the pants to the shirt , but my son was able to wear thermal pants comfortably under them to stay warm for trick - or - treating halloween night .",51,30
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,a little big but otherwise perfect . timely delivery and just as described .,12,31
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my daughter enjoyed wearing this costume for halloween but i do feel that the accessories could have been better quality . the outfit is a two piece and my daughter is a short petite 7 year old . the pants were way too long so i had to cuff them inside the leg and then pin it so it would not drag . the shirt was fine , but the elastic part on the chest pocket was too weak to hold the police badge . the belt for the waist was terrible . it was fraying before we even left the house for halloween . also it was so long , we had to overlap it for more than half her waist for the extra piece .",117,32
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"yes my son absolutely loved this costume , pants were a little big but did the job",16,33
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"great costume . size medium was way too long for my 7 year old , but we taped it up with fabric tape and it was fine .",25,34
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,this costume is great ! it is nice and light for comfortable play without being flimsy . the hat and accessories were a hit with my grandson .,24,35
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,the fit was good and the material and workmanship was what i expected for a costume .,16,36
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my 5 - year - old loved the costume . i had to hem and take in the pants a lot , but the shirt and the hat fit fine . she has 44 inches tall and 36 pounds . great quality , i imagine this would last for many hand - me - downs or dress - up days .",44,37
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,the costume and delivery was exactly what we expected . no problems what so ever !,14,38
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"this costume was cheaply made but it was ok for one night . the belt was very flimsy and would not support the handcuffs as they are shown . also , the police badge kept falling off of the shirt for some reason and we ended up losing it on the street . my son was not happy about that . the hat is also very misshapen . however , my son did enjoy wearing the costume and that is all that really matters .",76,39
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"the costume did not include badge , belt handcuffs . pants are very long however shirt is nice fit .",18,40
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"costume fit my 10 year old son perfectly . he is 80 pounds and 58 tall . it is the cheapo halloween costume fabric , and the accessories are chintzy but to a kid , it does not matter it looks real , therefore it is cool ! he is happy so i am too .",48,41
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,best ever ! he has even slept in it he loves it so much ! belt useless and no stick fyi,18,42
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,nice fabric . did not see the costume on but it was good quality .,13,43
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,pants are ridiculously big or long . must hem them . but it is absolutely adorable and looks like it will hold up reasonably well . badge will not stay on shirt but overall great purchase .,30,44
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,my grandsons love to play dress up in this police uniform . the fit was true to size and well made .,20,45
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my 10 year old daughter asked for a police uniform for christmas . we ordered her this costume with another set of handcuffs reviews said handcuffs were not great they were correct , as they broke within hours . i have washed the uniform and it has held up . she is on the smaller size , we ordered her the size recommended for a typical 10 year old and it was just a little big for her . based on this , i would say it runs true to size . it is a nice costume for the price - but order sturdier handcuffs to go with it !",100,46
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"i thought this was a very good quality costume and i would recommend this to others . the pants were a little big for my 5 1/2 year old son , but it just gives him room to grow in .",38,47
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,lots of fun for my son . he loved the outfit for halloween and after school playing cops and robbers .,19,48
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,it is a good costume but it runs big . my 6yr old is swimming in the pants .,16,49
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,our grandson loved this uniform and wears it often . good quality for the money .,14,50
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"the sizes run smaller here . barely fit my 9 year old and i ordered 10 - 12 . quality was as expected , nothing fancy .",21,51
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,it was a great custom my son enjoyed it ! fit him really well the pants were a little big but gave him room to put pants under neath to stay warm ! do with the hat had a lot more structure to it . but over all it was a great costume ! give it 4 stars .,54,52
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my son liked it . my only complaint was the hat was kinda cheap feeling so i bought a nicer one at party city and it worked . other than that , happy with purchase .",32,53
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,it looked great on me ! it also came with everything said ! i loved this costume because it was good quality and if you loose the handcuff keys there is a thing you push . i i is worth the money with free shipping . this costume is worth it !,47,54
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,the material is thin which is suitable for our weather summer all year round . he is slightly shorter than 120 am and the pants are too long . some alteration will do the trick . i thought the baton will be included but it was not . he still loves the costume and can not stop wearing it .,52,55
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,cute base costume . we ended up getting a different belt and badge than the one that came with the costume to make the costume cooler .,25,56
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,we got just what we expected in a timely manner,10,57
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,i had to dress my son up as a community helper for school . this was a great little costume for this day .,22,58
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"this costume was made of very nice quality fabric . i did have to hem the pants for my five year old but he adored wearing it . the handcuffs were pretty cheap and easily broke and the badge did not want to stay on when he was wearing it . other than that , we were very happy .",55,59
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"it is a pretty good costume ; the quality as with most costumes is not great , but it got us through halloween ! i bought the small and it was a little big for my 6 year old boy ; definitely room to grow ! overall , i would recommend it ; just know that it is cheap and do not expect fine craftsmanship ! i",56,60
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my son was thrilled when this arrived and wanted to wear it immediately ! it ess for halloween , but i did let him wear it a few times before the big day . he thought it was great an had a blast with it , but i was very disappointed . everything about this costume was cheaply made . the belt frayed and was not wearable after one use . the little handcuffs broke while handcuffing the first bad guy big bro and the hat was just a piece of fabric , no structure . thankfully at a young 6 , my son did not care . next time i will look for better quality .",103,61
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"the costume was very realistic and my son loved it . as others said , the belt is of poor quality . overall , a decent value !",23,62
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"this costume was cute and convincing on a small middle schooler for our play . the belt and handcuffs were cheaply made and not usable , and we replaced the hat with a sturdier theatrical prop , but the costume itself was nicely made and washable .",43,63
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,my friends kid loved this costume . we also bought him handcuffs separately and a gun as well . he loves it a lot !,23,64
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"my son was desperate to get this costume , and the waiting was worth it . the material is a little bit on the cheap side but for the price , i think can not complaint .",33,65
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"while i know that halloween costumes are typically cheaply made and over - priced for what you are getting , this is truly gives meaning to the word crap . the thing , slinky material is see - throughout can not go trick - or - treating in that without a few layers ! also , the i emblem on the front was messed up and looked like it had not been allowed sufficient time to dry before the item was packaged . to make it worse , returns are a complete pain . you have to email the merchant for a return authorization number or it will be refused at the door , and you only have until a certain date to return it . i will never , ever order rom this merchant again . take heed to my warning no matter how much your little peanut loves the incredibles . order from another merchant at the very least .",140,0
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"our little boy wanted an incredible suit for halloween . he was only 2 1/2 years old so i was worried the suit would be too big , but it fit great . he loved the suit , and several months later he is still occasionally wearing it . the suit is well made and has yet to show any signs of wear .",58,1
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,thin but easy to wear clothing under it,8,2
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"this was a good material for the price , fit good but may size a little small . delivery on time .",19,3
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,expected somewhat better quality for the price . super thin and screen print emblem . not worth some amount of money but i guess worth your kid dressing up in the character they really wanted . what has a mom to do ? !,35,4
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,my son wears size 3 i and this fits him fairly well . he has been wearing it all evening and running around but it is staying on good . the mask fits his smaller face well . we will have to roll up the sleeves and legs a bit but it will work fine for playing superhero or for halloween .,53,5
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,obviously the material will not be the best of the best but it does it is job and my 3 year old is absolutley in love with it and that is what counts . good price compared to halloween stores where you pay 30 bucks for the same material !,45,6
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"oh my god ! my grandson looks so cute in this outfit ! it is a little big , he has only 2 1/2 so he can wear it for a while .",25,7
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,perfect for my 3 year old son ! held up well for multiple halloween parties .,14,8
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,our son dash loves dressing up in it,8,9
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,my 2 and a half year old loved it he would not take it off,14,10
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,could not believe how fast the product arrived at my door . i placed the order on friday morning and it arrived by sunday . unreal . the costume is great . great price . great costume . can not beat it .,34,11
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"my 3 year old son who wears 4 i clothes fit this outfit perfectly ! and it is super adorable to me because i got the matching mrs. incredible outfit . so both of our costumes together are the cutest ! but my little man fit this perfectly ! not too short , not too roomy , he can still wear a long sleeve shirt and a pair of long john pants on under to keep warm because it is going to be cold outside , and the costume will still fit perfectly ! he loves it ! and so do i !",90,12
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,great costume for my son was delivered fast,8,13
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,fits my three year old perfectly ! he loves it !,9,14
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,son wanted to be dash so this fit the bill . my son is small so this fit but i am going to i think it runs small . mask is way small useless i it is cheap but will do for one night .,39,15
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,oh boy ! all 3 grandsonssome amountovedsome amountovedsome amounted them ! made very wellcome amounted packaging . was a big hit !,18,16
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,my 2 year old loves it . he has 29 pounds and almost three feet tall and it fits him perfect . the only issue is the mask . it barely fits his head and is really tight on his face .,37,17
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,i like it so much ! but i would suggest it will be made with a percentage cotton . my son is allergic to polyester and although he loves to wear his costume it is not possible to let him to use it for long time because his skin starts to rash . cotton would be more fresh and easy to wear for kids . overall the costume is awesome !,65,18
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,the costume looks exactly like the advertised picture except for the boots are not included . my son is absolutely excited to wear this .,23,19
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"great value , made wellcome amounted colors but the straps on the mask is not made very well so it was too tight . i had to make new straps but overall my son loved the costume .",35,20
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,great costume for my 3 year old . it held up well at disney world for the mickeys not so scary halloween party !,22,21
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,the costume worked perfect for my son . it looks just like the photo minus the black shoes . we just put black socks or shoes on him,24,22
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"mask can easily tear , costume fits great . true to size . need to but black shoes separately . my boy loves it .",20,23
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"it is a simple costume . the mask did not fit my child and in fact the elastic snapped while trying to fit it . i will have to buy a separate mask . my son loves it , so i guess that is all that matters , but i think the price is too high for the thinness and cheap make .",54,24
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"size and description were exactly right . my son can not wait to wear it for halloween . it was a great price , too !",21,25
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,my son wore this for multiple birthday parties and it even washed well . he loves it . fits more like a solid 3t. would start to get snug on a 4t.,30,26
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"my obsessive dash - son loved it . wore it for days and days before halloween . the mask was iffy . never really fit to where he could see out of it , but the clear sides on it which make the mask float on their face like the ones in the movie were really cool , and in general , it was great . downside . it will not last much longer , as it is just worn down pretty quickly . we still have some use left , but it is not going to make it a full year . pros : fun and true to the movie cons : cheaply made . but hey . for the price !",97,27
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,we bought this for our son to wear for halloween . material is very thin and tore during the hour it was worn . not what i would consider a quality item .,30,28
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"nice cute costume , but the fabric seems very fragile especially if it got stuck onto finger nails , there has be a pull in the threads . nonetheless , it is cuteness makes up for it .",31,29
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,excellent costume ! got it as a gift for my nieces 3rd birthday and she was thrilled ! made her day ! thanks !,20,30
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"it is not made better or worse than most other kids costumes . your child will be a lot warmer with clothes on underneath it , but it still looks good on alone . and it is easy to take on and off . we also like the fact that the mask is not so tight that it hurts his head . he has been wearing it all day long and it has not left a mark ! overall , this costume was worth the money for us .",77,31
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,i bought this for the homework help center at my local library . the librarians were thrilled with it and we know it will be useful for the upcoming school year when the elementary kids are studying fractions .,37,0
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,i am amazed at the amount of learning they facilitate . my students love to use these tiles . it really helps them to be able to see the fractions and compare and make equivalent fractions .,34,1
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"these are great for explaining the fraction concepts to children . my kids got it right away , and every time we need to come back to them , they are there , more clear than any explaining i can do ! love these .",38,2
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"it works well teaching fractions , just wish it would be easier to store without all the pieces falling out .",19,3
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"this is a good tool for teaching fractions . the pieces are somewhat small , although , and easy to misplace . i would recommend working on a table with this one .",27,4
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"this product was exactly as described . it loses one star from me because one row of tiles is slightly too big and it buckles just a bit in the tray . and also because it does not have a cover , making it really hard to store unless you keep it in the box with is about 3/4 deep . i have limited storage in my home , and storing something so flat in something 3 - 4 times it size is aggravating .",76,5
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,my daughter was thrilled with it . it is the same one she uses at school !,15,6
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,i use it in my 4th grade special ed class . they love it !,13,7
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"bought this item for my seven year old . we used it as a game , and she really enjoyed it . she has not started fractions yet in school however i know from her grasp of using the tiles that this tool will help her no end .",45,8
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,these are a wonderful tool that truly help my third grader visualize fractions when trying to figure out greater and lesser fractions .,22,9
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,he learned so fast from this . things clicked in his head made fractions so easy !,15,10
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,my 3 year old is extremely interested in numbers . this has been a great tool to take numbers to the next level . now he is always showing me halves and wholes they have stickers and stuff to show more details of what the fractions mean in other ways . i would get this again for sure .,55,11
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"some of the rows of pieces do not fit in perfectly , but my son seems to enjoy playing with them anyway .",20,12
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,one of my favorite teaching tools in 5th grade .,9,13
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,i want to like this more . as a concept it is great for teaching fractions . but what i would really love is for it to be magnetic and or or have a locking lid to keep all the pieces contained . it comes with additional stickers you can use that use other fractions like pie charts and decimals . again it is a good resource but i wish they put a little bit more effort into it to make it a more solid resource and not so easy to lose or misplace pieces or awkward to store .,93,14
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,this would be ten times cooler if it was wood . but it is still a super cool learning toy . we homeschool so it will be used with most of our meals and baking and whatever else we can get creative with !,39,15
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"made fractions for my daughter so much easier , especially with her propensity towards spatial learning .",15,16

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,as described ; useful tool for us as we homeschool . not too flimsy either,13,18
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"my daughter was using this product in her class for learning fractions . she was having a harder time at home without it , so i ordered her one to use here . she loved the ease of it and this product sure did make fraction homework a lot quicker !",47,19
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,these tiles are perfect for our homeschool classroom .,8,20
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,kids like playing with it . would be improved if it included percentages or decimals on the flip side of the tiles .,21,21
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"bought it for a 10 year old who found it interesting and has quickly discovered relations between various fractions . it is summer vacation so i did not expect her to pay much attention to it now , but she has taken it off the shelf several times to just play with it . i am sure it will come in handy when school starts . interestingly , my 3.5 yo is also playing with it , calling it a puzzle . some of the blocks do not fit in a certain order but then fit perfectly after rearranging .",90,22
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"extremely useful for visualizing fractions i bought it for my second grader , but also found it helped me",19,23
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,good product for my 3rd and 4th graders,8,24
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,anything from learning resources is well worth purchasing . i am a tutor and my students love their manipulative .,18,25
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,my 9 year old likes working with it and he said it is very helpful . came on time and even had extras that i was not expecting . pie chart and anther fraction chart ! bought one for a friend .,36,26
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,got this for my son to use to help with his math homework . they use these in school . it really helped him understand his fractions better . it was also a great tool for him to use with his tutor .,39,27

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"one of my children struggled with fractionsthis was an invaluable tool . i can not recommend it enough . now , with my younger children is the only way we teach the topic . they learn their coursework and then practice with these . if your child struggles makes it easier to explain to them . excellent tool !",57,29
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,this is my favorite tool for teaching fractions .,8,30
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"i bought this for my third grader to teach him fractions . he loves using them , and they have been a great help .",22,31
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"these are a great visual for my child learning fractions . but they only have the evens 1/6 , 1/8 and more , so they can not be used on problems with an odd denominator . also , the tray is nice if you are laying it flat , but what am i supposed to do when it gets tilted to the side and the all fall out . ugh .",61,32
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"this is a great fraction resource . i love how you can really visually illustrate fractions in a way that even a kindergartner can understand . my favorite part is that the pieces line up , so , for instance , if you are trying to show how it takes 2 1/4s to make a 1/2 , you can easily see how they add up . then you can show how 4 1/8s make 1/4 , and the 1/8 , 1/4 , and 1/2 all add up . it really is great for kids to understand fractions in this way . i would buy this product over and over again . the only thing that is a downside is , as others have mentioned , that the tiles are hard to keep in place . it would not be hard to put a lip on either side of the product holder and have a plastic sleeve that could slide in the lip and hold everything in place . i use about 5 well - places rubberband to hold everything in place once we have it put together . still , i love this product and have not seen any other fractions help that is nearly as great as this one .",186,33
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,just wish it was a little larger for my kindergartners .,10,34
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"the tiles did not fit in the board , bad cut . my son wants succession why they chose to skip numbers is hard for little minds . nit worth the money .",29,35

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,great learning tool for todays children . i wish it would have come with some sort of container better than the packaging as the pieces tend to fall out easily . a great deal of these learning tools are on the upper scale of price in regards to the materials used . the construction of this is very basic and nothing extraordinary .,59,43
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"nice set , but i should have gotten the magnetic ones . easy fix is to buy the magnetic sheets arts crafts store , office supply , or amazon ! and stick them on , then use a magnetic white board .",35,44
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"it is easy for an adult to know 1/2 cup is less than 1 cup , and we can tell our kids that and have them memorize it , but to take it one step further and show them how each fraction differs from another is better . these are great for younging as well as older children who are identifying , comparing , adding , subtracting and even multiplying and dividing them !",66,45

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"i got this for my daughter who is a tactile learner 3rd grade . each plastic chip is a sturdy 1/8 thick . she enjoys dumping them out and putting them back together in various measurements . fractions can be particularly confusing since the denominator is larger than the numerator , yet here it is easy to see that 1/3 is larger than 1/4 . this is a terrific addition to your ensemble of fractions tools if you like manipulative . the reason for the minus star is because i can only store this flat or all the tiles fall out .",95,52
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,good tool and manipulative for teaching fractions ; particularly 1 - to-1 settings but would have preferred the white board being magnetic in function . easy to loose pieces once the package is open .,30,53

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"i rarely write a review , but after seeing how well both my kids 5 and 7 learned their fractions from this toy ? i went searching for the review box . both kids enjoy just putting the tiles into the right place for fun . even this simple task helps them to see how the fractions fit together . we can do so many things with this and it is so easy for them to see how the fractions go together . how the fractions add up and how 2/4 is so obviously also 1/2 and more i am truly amazed at how well this has worked for them . i highly recommend and am very thankful to have found this math tool . this is one of those very few things i will pack away and save for their kids to have someday .",136,56

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"some amounting many others , purchased this for our home school classroom . we use the montessori method and this fits perfect with it . the tiles and frame are a little thinner than i expected reason for four stars , but with the training of caring for our work materials , i do not see that as a problem . ours also came with stickers for making cards as well . an added bonus and time saver for me , since that was on my to do list already !",81,69

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"i have been a math teacher from elementary to middle school . i have seen much more interesting and fun ways to discover fractional parts . i had bought this for my preschool son hoping it could be fun to put them in rows and talk about them , but bagged that idea early on . i kept them hoping to pull them out later but i do not know how much use i will get out of them . the materials are thin and feel cheap . the tray is a pitiful plastic and does not have a lid . this makes them all pile up in the box so they are rarely all put away in the tray in a way you could compare them . this might be fine for a 3rd-5th grader , but is certainly not the first math manipulative i would buy .",135,75

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"i got these for my 2nd grade daughter who was being introduced to fractions . when i try to get them out , she just sighs says , yeah mom , i already know it ! she finds them boring is much more interested in more applicable fractions such as cutting a pizza , candy bar , and more also , i found that it has a good many fraction pieces , but when you go to comparing that 1/3 of 6 is 2 , it does not allow for that computation as there are no 1/6th pieces to compare . however , with the cuisenaire rods , you can easily compute that 1/3 of six is the rod with 2 cubes . anyway , i bought both items at about the same time have really not used these as the cuisenaire rods seem to do what these do , plus so much more . learning resources connecting cuisenaire rods introductory set",148,79
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"the fraction strips are eightsome amounted sized and easy to handle by both students teachers . the fractions are easy to read , easy to decipher and easy to handle . the only thing i would change is the plastic base to something a little sturdier , but the fraction pieces themselves are solid . also , the board does have to be handled on a flat surface , to keep the pieces in place . however , my third grader used the pieces individually on his desk as much as he did sitting neatly in the set , in order to compare and contrast the various sizes .",99,80
