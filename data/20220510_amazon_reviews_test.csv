CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"Good compilation, but get the original two albums if you possibly can. (This CD is from his two original albums/CDs: Wonderful World of Christmas and This Christmas I Spend With You.) Robert Goulet's Wonderful World of Christmas is the best Christmas CD you can get. Hard to find, but worth it.",51,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,Have tried for years to buy this album but was too expensive around the time of his death. Enjoyed it so much this holiday season. It arrived in perfect shape. I have ordered things before from Amazon and have been very satisfied.,42,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"Excellent selection from one of the ""Christmas Masters of Song"".  It's a shame that more Christmas songs of Goulet aren't available on CD.",23,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,A bit expensive at $70 for a used cd but I played the cd and I am happy. Maybe I won't play this cd anymore so that I can keep it at it's original form.,35,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"Hello - I am interested in this CD but 1st, I'd need more details - to know all the songs on it!

Thank you!",24,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,Can't go wrong with Robert Goulet - and Christmas!,9,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,This was a favorite album in my childhood and I am so pleased to have it on CD now. It's just as wonderful as I remembered.,26,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"This is the ultimate Christmas album in my house!!  I grew up with this album (and many others) being played everyday between Thanksgiving and Christmas!!  Just hearing the first few notes takes me back 25-30 years easily!!  I turned my husband on to Mr. Goulet some 10 years ago and now he (and our 3 children) love it too!  A must have!  I just got the CD last year (after much searching).  I still have the original album, but the kids can't understand why you can't jump up and down while listening to an album, besides it's nice to have this one to listen to in the van!!",108,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without Robert Goulet! It's wonderful to hear his voice again on all of these songs. My personal favorite is ""This Christmas I Spend with You."" ""Christmas Day"" is a song I haven't heard very often, but R.G.'s rendition is terrific! Every song on this CD is a winner!!!  If you love Robert Goulet and Christmas music, this CD is for you!!",66,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"This is the type of album they don't make anymore, classic Christmas songs (both religous and secular) with great arrangements and orchestrations.  Goulet's version of Panis Angelicus is breathtaking.  I have dozens of really great Christmas albums (Mathis, Williams, Crosby) and this album takes it's place right alongside those.  If you like the idea of an old fashioned Christmas you'll love this album.",63,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"Again 20 words, whew.  The songs are few, knew this.  I didn't expect reverberation to be used.  If I want to hear reverberation, I would buy a reverb amplifier.
Sent quickly to me.  Excelent results, no damage to case or disc.",41,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"I bought this CD for that one song alone!  My parents had a compilation LP (now in my collection) that included Barbra Streisand, Julie Andrews, and many other incredible singers.  I think it was a giveaway at Christmas at the Firestone tire store -- no I'm not kidding -- and the most incredible thing on that whole album was Robert Goulet singing Panis Angelicus.  I had never heard the song before, don't know Latin.....but oh my God

I picked it up on eBay a few days ago.  There were 3-4 other copies available.  While I do have that vinyl LP, and enjoy all of the other songs and singers on it, this is the one I ""need"" on CD format so I can carry it around, load it into my computer, include it in my own Christmas playlists....  I am looking forward to the other material on the CD, but all I need is Panis Angelicus.  Obviously, for me this is the definitive rendition of this beautiful song.",168,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,I love it! By far my most favorite Christmas album.  Robert Goulet was a master and to hear him croon some of my favorite Christmas songs is awesome!,28,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"I love this CD, I listened to the LP in college 34 years ago!  I have looked for it before and couldn't find it...it brings me back.",27,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002AJ9,"Love, love and loved Robert Goulet.  From Camelot to Las Vegas Goulet.  I miss his voice so much.  This CD brings back memories.",23,14
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"I'm sad that I did not read it long ago. It turns out I've had it on my kindle for quite a while. I loved it! I love all of Farrah's books but it was good to read Mason's story as I'd read Kiera's story first. I love the Maplesville and Gauthier, LA series as well as all of her other books and will continue to read her stories....",69,0
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"I enjoyed the second installment of the Maplesville series. It's short, but feels like a regular book. I enjoyed reading about Jada and Mason, who are enemies that find they have some naughty  things in common.  I can't wait until the next installment.",43,1
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"This is the second installment from Farrah Rochon's Moments in Maplesville series.  A Little Bit Naughty is Jada Dangerfield's story. Her knight in shining armor is Mason Coleman, her nemesis throughout high school and the older brother of her best friend Kiera.  I love Jada and Mason's story and their oil and water relationship.  So happy they found love in the end.  A short read, but very enjoyable.  A must purchase.",71,2
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"I really like this book.  The plot was well fleshed out.  Jada and Mason had been antagonizing one another since high school.  He's more straight laced than she.  Unbeknownst to her, he has always been interested in her but had his reasons for keeping his distance and acting hostile toward her.  Usually, when that is the scenario, I find that the reasons are ridiculous.  However, in this case, I didn't find his reasons to be ridiculous.  I liked the fact that even though Jada was not as straight laced as Mason, she wasn't over the top Bohemian flighty either.  She was actually pretty grounded.  Anyway, I like how the story and the relationship progressed.  There was no jumping into bed two chapters in.  I'll read this author again.",128,3
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,This was a sweet book that reminded me that there are still some knights in shining armor in the world.,20,4
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,Great story.  Being from Louisiana I almost googled to see if any of those small towns are real! Loved the chemistry between the leads well developed characters.,27,5
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,I enjoyed this continuation of the Maplesville series. Jada and Mason were able to begin a relationship that Mason had dreamed about since high school. Ms. Rochon in did an excellent job in  writing this book. I look forward to book#3.,41,6
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,This is the second book I've read by this author and I really enjoyed it. I look forward to reading more of her books.,24,7
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"I fell in love with these characters and the author did a great job moving the story along.  I'm not a big review person so I pretty much keep things short.  When I don't feel as if I've hit a snag in a story, it gets 5 stars.",48,8
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,Who would have thought Mason would be a closet freak? Way to go Ms. Rochon keep up the good work.,20,9
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,Please let there be more to Jada and Mason 's story!?  I would love to read more about them and see where their relationship goes.,25,10
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,This latest novella from Farrah Rochon was great. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it last night. The chemistry between Mason and Jada was hot. Can't wait until the next novella in this series.,37,11
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,I enjoyed this book.  The fact that the love making was sweet and sexy made me look forward to each session. I also enjoyed the fact that Masons biggest sin was trying trying to take care of the women in his life.,42,12
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"Jada and Mason appear to be public enemy #1 but they say it's a thin line.  Find how true that is in this romantic tale.  Mason has had the hots for Jada for years but like little boys doesn't how to express it.  So, of course Jada thinks the worst of him.  When they clash of her ""naughty"" business, sparks begin to fly!",63,13
Kindle_Store,B00BRVXQWU,"I LOVE Farrah Rochon and I always forget until I pick up one of her books and am left speechless. this little diddy went above and beyond my expectations. Mason and Jada's relationship was fire, flawed and going to last forever. My favorite kind of romances are love/hate and unrequited love and this was both in one.
Everyone needs to invest in this book. it's a quick read, realistic and oh so kinky! can't wait for the next installment!",79,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,great quality but the album its self is kinda eh,10,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"With this band you kinda of know what you are going to get. It's not absolutely ground breaking, but it follows a simple formula. Theres always that 3 Doors Down sound thrown in. It's a good album, but I feel like all their albums are starting to sound similiar. This could be my last album from them that I buy. Thats not to say they have a bad album because they don't. Plus their packaging is always cool.",78,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"I'm a writer, so music is a necessity for me. Listening to differing types of music helps me to set the mood for different scenes - rock music for action scenes, etc. Upon looking at some MP3 albums on here, I had the thought to look for 3 doors down, seeing as I've always enjoyed their music. So far, this is my favorite album by them., I was bobbing my head from the title track ""Time of my life"" all the way to the end. I'm addicted to more than one song on the album, and now listen to it every day. Seriously glad I found this one, and for $5, I think it's way worth it. Do not pass this album up!",123,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"I've been a fan of 3 Doors Down for many years, and I like all of their past albums 5/5 stars, but this time is different for Time of My Life, this album disappoints me just a little bit. I rate this album 4/5 stars, because there isn't one song I really connect to like I've on their previous albums. I know every band evolves after so long, but did they pick the right time to do it, this many years in their career? I personally think they're starting to sound more mainstream, and I don't like that much. Time of My Life is a bit of a change from their previous albums, this album is softer than their previous albums. I don't think this time around, that this album was worth the 3 year wait. This album is still good, but not great like their other albums.",148,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"I have been a 3 Doors Down fan from the first album. If you have been also then you will not be dissapointed nor surprised by this offering. The formula is there and TDD does not break from it very much. It's just a good rock album as all of them have been. I doubt that the fan base will expand because of this album but they certainly won't lose any fans over it. These guys have settled into their comfort zone long ago and know what they are doing and seem to have fun doing it.
Simply put, if you have bought their past albums then buy this one. If you are not a fan and know little about this band, I suggest picking up their first album which has the hit Superman on it and give it shot. You'll probably be hooked and start buying the rest in short order.",152,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,I really liked all their previous CDs but I just can't connect with this one.  There is not even one exceptional song and the overall tone strikes me as having a country/redneck flavor that does not appeal to me.  I am disappointed because I actually liked the last CD better than the previous one so I wasn't expecting such a drop-off.,61,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"this is truly a great cd with great acoustics and lyrics they give a top performance with no exceptions. if you like them, you will like this.",27,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,One of their best yet. I highly recommend this to fans of this genre....It is awesome and I loved every song.,21,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"Here you have 3 doors down with their new cd and let me tell you it's one of their best!
It's an album you have to listen to a few times and then you know what i'm talking about!
Real great stuff and everyday i have a new favorite just like BELIEVER, Round And Round and then there's HEAVEN just great.
But this is just my review and i'm a big fan from holland and i love those guys to death.
my least favorite is 'Race For The Sun' but after 01:40 i love the song.
It's just a matter of taste but i recomment it to everyone who loves great music without the reviews of some sites!!",118,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"I love three doors down but honestly only one song stands out on this cd, yup you gussed it, ""when you're young"" and while its a good song i can only take so much. all the rest of the songs blend in together and i was pretty much disappointed for how much i payed for this cd. lets just say i expected much more and maybe a few heavier songs in the mix.",73,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,This band has been putting out stellar stuff but have to stay this one is just ok. There is the same old same old and some new vibes songs going on here.,32,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"I've come to respect this band a lot.  They deliver some of the best melodic rock available nowadays, along with Incubus.  This is a very good album that represents its maturity and evolution since the ""Kryptonite"" days, following the ""Here Without You"" breakthrough.",43,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"3 DOORS DOWN IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE BAND, AND THIS ALBUM DOESN'T CHANGE THAT.  THIS ALBUM, JUST LIKE EVERY ONE THEY HAVE PUT OUT, IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE THE LAST!  THIS ALBUM IS EXCEPTIONAL. THE SONGS ON IT GIVE YOU SUCH A GREAT FEELING, WITH A DIFFERENT FEELING WITH EACH SONG.  MY FAVORITES WOULD HAVE TO BE ""HEAVEN"", WHAT'S LEFT"", AND ""ROUND AND ROUND"", BUT EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME!!! FIVE OUT OF FIVE STARS WITHOUT A DOUBT! LOVE IT!  ALSO, THE BONUS DVD IS FANTASTIC!  IT INCLUDES I THINK FOUR SONGS FROM TIME OF MY LIFE AS WELL AS ""KRYTONITE"", AWAY FROM THE SUN"", AND ""LET ME BE MYSELF"".  ITS PRETTY AWESOME!  GREAT PURCHASE AND YOU WILL LOVE IT!",125,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"This is a great CD
just a good rock CD - I don't see how you can not like this one",21,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00518HBD0,"Great CD. Great band. not as good as their other works, but still great!",14,14
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"If you like dogs and sweet romance, this is just up your alley.  Fast paced and sweet. Love it. This is a great little read for a holiday evening when there's too much going on to kick back with a novel.  Romance and action : a great combo.",48,0
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"A great holiday short read.  It has a good plot and a sweet romance for both people and dogs. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",27,1
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"Very short and easy to read. Middle School reading level but with adult content. No descriptive sex. I would call this a quick fluff book, very little content. Several typos through out the text.",34,2
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"A quick read with characters it's easy to care about, this story is perfect for a lunch or midweek evening entertainment choice. No explicit sex whatsoever. As a short romance, in which the characters need to get to the HEA in very few pages, the story holds its own. Well edited and written. Recommended.",54,3
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"It's Christmas time and I am so busy, but can't put my kindle down. This is the perfect short story. A romance with just a little suspense for the holidays. It's a cute short story so you can get it read and onto all the other stuff that needs to be done. I hate for a book to end, so I did think it could have been a little longer.",70,4
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"Cute story but wothout a great deal of substance. Would liked to have seen a longer, more involved story. Otherwise, okay.",21,5
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"What a fun book.  Very enjoyable, will keep an eye out for this author. Loved the characters, dogs and Christmas setting",21,6
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"Expected a sweet Christmas story but found a shallow tale with limited believability.  The storyline had potential.  It would have made a great detective novel, only the juicy details were bunched up at the end like an after thought.  Next Christmas I expect more excitement from this author.",48,7
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"This was a quick read, but very enjoyable.  Nina kept a light tone overall even though the criminal was of the most despicable sort.  The characters both human and canine were very likable.",33,8
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"This short feature was full of favorite things: Santa, dogs, cops and love. Throw in a frustrating mystery case and characters who actually get out of their heads and attempt to communicate with each other eventually, make this one a keeper. It was really a fun read.",47,9
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"Love, love, loved this short story. It was sweet and cute and chock full of happy, feel good moments! The characters were endearing and likable, the dogs adorable, the writing was excellent. This is a lovely and quick holiday romance that left a huge grin on my face. I absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone! It's my new holiday go-to for rereading!",63,10
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"I really enjoyed this fun short holiday story.  Romantic, sexy and dogs - what more could a reader want!  Definitely worth a quick read.",24,11
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"This was a cute Christmas novella about a girl, dogs, a cop and Santa Claus. A perfect story for the holidays!",21,12
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,"Nice, short story. Both characters were likeable. Their pets were equally or more entertaining, and cute. I loved how the heroine is able to help the hero with his investigation at the end. I would have liked the story to have taken longer than it did for the characters to get to know each other. It seemed too sudden.",59,13
Kindle_Store,B00AM28RDI,A light holiday read - and it was certainly worth the price. I would pick up another book by this author,21,14
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"This is a fun read, keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next and how will the characters get out of their latest problem.  Seriously, this is a tense, taut thriller that is not filled with blood and gore, at least not too much, just enough.  The author makes you feel the characters stress.  It is not overly complicated and you might wonder why some of the characters bad decisions aren't more obvious to them.  But it is an interesting page turner.  Try it, you'll like it.",92,0
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"For a stand-alone novel, this book had a horrible ending. If it had not been on my Kindle, I would have thrown the book across the room. I feel that the story is incomplete and waiting for a sequel, but there is no sequel to this story. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the action packed read, even though you have to get one-third of the way through before the action grips you. Once  you reach that part, the book is difficult to put down. Then the ending leaves you with multiple loose ends that will never be resolved.",104,1
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"Great read!  Lots of action, well written great adventure story! I had a hard time putting the book down!  It leaves the end open for a seuquel and I hope there will be one.",34,2
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"Book dragged for most of story and then ended suddenly. The final paragraph simply stopped the story in mid event as if the author simply gave up too tired to finish. That or he had a heart attack in mid sentence and someone else wrote ""the end"".",47,3
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,I struggled to maintain enthusiasm for this book.  The characters were pretty one dimensional and failed to garner my sympathies.  The author clearly set this up for a sequel leaving me unsatisfied at the end.,35,4
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,This author loves to stop a book in the middle of a though. I would suggest like his last series to wait until this series is completed before you start reading the books. If you doin't you will only be fustrated.,41,5
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"Sorry but didn't like this book at all. Characters are one dimensional, the dialogue is stilted and character interactions are predictable.  This could have used more editing.",27,6
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"Too many unanswerd questins.

Too many unanswered questions. Just when you think you are going to find out what happens with the main characters, you get a big THE END. Hate I spent money on this!",36,7
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,I enjoyed this book. It is a very good archaeological under the sea mystery.  J.T. Cross has written another exceptional fast paced story that keeps you up late into the night.,31,8
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"Fun read that draws you in quickly. A bit far fetched and some of the central themes of the book are never brought full circle. But, it is still an entertaining read  that  is hard to put down at times. I would recommend and I will look for more JT Cross going forward.",53,9
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,I could not put the book down from the beginning to end. It was captivating and full of suspense. Great read!,21,10
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,Doesn't really end. Lots of loose ends so I assume there is a sequel. I would have given it a four otherwise.,22,11
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"Lots of action,romance and excitement.,I have read several books from  this author and  I have really enjoyed them all.
  this a",21,12
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,"Great read, action packed you will not want to put it down. And will want more after it's over. Read it it's good!",23,13
Kindle_Store,B00I0GWEXC,Excellent story!  Lots of excitement and panic.  Just wish it didn't end so abrupt.  Hope to see a sequence to this one.,22,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,i love hezekiah Walker music. the old ones are awesome. great music. Anointed man of God. Kepp the musci coming,20,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,"We bought this CD because we just love the song ""I Need You To Survive"".  We used to sing it in one of our previous congregations and wanted to introduce it to the our current congregation.  The song moves us to want to be better in our relationships and reminds us just how important each of our brothers and sisters are to us.",63,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,I have always enjoyed Walker's music.  It is original and I listen to it in my car.  It's upbeat and makes the trips easier.,24,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,Great condition! Thank you so much! I love the cd. Great songs. Both CDs play very well and the case in also in great condition.,25,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,"There were no scratches or issues with the CDs, both CDs played perfectly.  The CD has all of the great Hezekiah songs, blessed my spirit.",25,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,Great cd to stir up the gift and get that annoiting flowing,12,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,"I just bought The Essential Hezekiah Walker, and love the C.D. It's great and uplifting.",15,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,A GREAT COLLABORATION OF SONGS FROM ALL OF HIS ALBUMS. I JUST GOT MY PRAISE ON WITH THIS. I JUST LOVED IT !,23,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,"I love Gospel Music and Hezekiah Walker is among my library of music on disc and on Pandora. The music is energizing, soothing, comforting, and I am able to sing along with it in my car.  It simply helps me enter in to praise and worship and I feel so much better and my day goes by much better after listing to gospel by Pastor Walker.",66,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,"WHOEVER picked the songs for this Essential CD are SPOT ON. THESE songs are the pinnacle of Hezekiah Walker and LFCC. I was surprised that they even went and got songs from 1992! His two albums before that, ""I'll Make It"" and ""Oh Lord, We Praise You"" are very rare to find, so I understand the songs from there not being on this CD, BUT Hez' Album from 2002 ""Family Affair 2"" has some good remakes of songs from those two albums, so its all good! If you were not a fan of Hez or never knew of him before his recent release, ""Azusa The Next Generation"", then THIS is the album you wanna get if you're interested in the LFCC sound. God Bless!!",124,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,The songs on these CDs are really good and can take you to the next level of your praise to God.,21,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,"You talking about sanging?  There is some sanging on this CD!!  I love it . . . I listen to it daily!!  I praise with, I worship with it!!  I love it!!  Hezekiah Walker is awesome . . . the way that God uses him is just Awesome!!",48,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,I absolutely LOVE my CD. I was going through some difficult times and was looking for a particular song and on this CD I found many songs that uplifts me daily.,31,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,It's okay but I was expecting much much more. I was disappointed in most of the songs on this album. I just could not get into all of them at all.,31,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000UZ4CY0,I love this choir and discovered them on their last release several years ago and made it a point to purchase all of their previous recordings.  I'm a baby boomer and think that their ministry is anointed and that their songs are theologically sound and touch the soul.  I love their church as well!,54,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"I had never heard of Emily Barker and the Red Clay Halo but I heard the theme song while watching the Wallander series on PBS and wondered who was performing that haunting song.  So I checked out the music credits and found Emily Barker.  I began sampling her songs through amazon.com and other websites.  I found her albums are not available in the states at a reasonable price but found a used album through the Amazon marketplace.  I must say I love every track on this album, especially ""Nostalgia,"" ""Disappear"" and ""Oh Journey."" The lyrics and the music make a distinct blend that's creative and fresh.  These songs stay in my mind and I find myself humming them at odd moments.  If you like folk/country you really need to check out Emily Barker.",133,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"This was not what I expected. I felt that by listening to the song ""Nostalgia,"" this would be more folk or folk rock, but it seems to be more of the country bent. However, she is very talented, & I do enjoy this CD & would purchase more by this artist.",51,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"I wasn't familiar with Emily Barker's music (other than Wallander) so I didn't really know what to expect. After listening to Snow, I can say that I'm still not all that knowledgeable of her overall sound but she is most definitely talented, clear of voice and one hell of a song writer/musician. This isn't the type of music that I, personally, listen to until I'm tired of, but rather will re-visit at various times when I either need a break from my normal listening habits or when I re-discover this album as I shuffle through my play list.",98,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,I found this music because of the author Henning Manckel.  His books about the detective Kurt Wallendar have been so good.  I saw that the BBC has made a film of one of the books starring Kenneth Branagh.  It was filmed in Sweden but everyone had a British Accent.  Funny.  The film was really good and followed the book closely.  At the end of the film an interview with Hennink Manckel was included.  He talked about the rennaissance of art in Scandanavia and got me started on going deeper into the genre.  The music for this wonderful film included this group and I liked the theme so I ordered the CD.  I have listened to it over and over and it is now one of the albums I can sing along with in the car.  I will buy another.,139,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001FA00M2,"When I first heard this music as the theme song on the Kurt Wallander BBC movies, I knew I wanted to hear more.  I was not disappointed.  Often only one song is a real winner, not so with Emily's cd.  Every song flows effortlessly to the next and none break the mood.  Everyone I have played this for has been impressed.  I even shared it with some of my friends from the Phila Folk Festival staff, who were equally impressed.  Maybe a US concert appearance is in your future??",89,4

Well, being the music addict I am, I had to have the rest of this album, so I took the plunge half expecting one great cut and the rest forgettable.  Well I can say that EVERY cut on this album is just great.  My favorites are ""Nostalgia"" and ""The Greenway"" but all are compelling, and the interesting blend of Emily's vocals with The Red Clay Halo's accompanyment is truly hypnotic.  Instruments used beside guitar, are piano, flute, accordion, cello, and musical saw.  Really a great album and worth the price, any price.

As a huge fan of American bluegrass and old-time, I was interested to learn about her Australian folk music. Emily's voice is beautiful, and her backing group the Red Clay Halo is pure genius: guitar, cello, fiddle and accordion. Who would have thought? It adds up to a 100% enjoyable listen.

This cd has half a dozen great songs that you could listen to over and over again.
It is hard to catagorize: Easy rock, hard pop but basically it keeps you entertained but does not promt other people around you to turn it down.
The first 5 songs are the best.",60,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002JWU,"This cd is one of the few cds i own that i actually like all of the songs.  It's quite rare that a cd impresses me that much on a first listening basis.  Like a lot of people, I listened to Matchbox 20 a LONG time on the  radio before i ever bought their cd, thinking that the cd probably wasn't  going to be very good, but the matchbox guys proved me seriously wrong!  The very first time i listened i loved absolutely EVERY song on the cd, and  became an instant fan.  While the music isn't exactly always cheery, Rob  Thomas' lyrics and music speak to you in a way that is universally true and  leaves you feeling pretty good after you listen.  If you don't have this  cd, I'd suggest getting it...you won't be disappointed!",137,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002JWU,"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I love it. Rob Thomas lyrics are true to life. It is clear he with deep inside himself to write many of the songs. The band members do a wonderful job arranging the instruments. I have heard Matchbox 20 play live, and it is just wonderful to hear the songs come to life.
This album can fit several moods and situations. It has been there for me on good and bad days. This album does what many albums don't anymore. The lyric can be intrepreted in a variety of way. I love it.",104,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002JWU,"The readers of Rolling Stone magazine were right when they chose Matchbox 20 as the best new artist of 1997. With exquisite instrumentals and ethereal vocals, this band has blown away critics and music lovers alike.  The incredible songs on this album have a definite profound quality, and  one can find so many different meanings in the layers of depth that Rob  Thomas (lead vocals, lyricist) has created. Not to mention the beautiful  guitar melodies and crashing drum beats. Unlike other albums, the songs on  Yourself Or Someone Like You actually sound independent from each other.  Compare the soft ""Back 2 Good"" to the pounding ""Busted""  and you'll see that this isn't another cookie-cutter band.  Matchbox 20 may  be popular, but that fact shouldn't discredit them. This album is a gem,  one of the few that never leaves my CD player. I found someone who seems to  understand me in this music. Because I'm not the only one who's  ""terrified of no one else but me"".",166,4

However, whenever I listen to ""back 2 good"", I feel like I am actually transported into the body of a person who has deep pain and sorrow. This song continues to have an effect on me over 10 years later from the first time I heard it. Most of the other songs are great for the unusual mix of depth and pop appeal. This album is highly recommended!",94,6

I am lucky, because I don't listen to the radio and I hardly ever watch MTV or VH1, I have yet to  get sick of the songs on this CD, I bought it when it first came out and I  still listen to it constantly.
Best songs:  Kody (there is a lot of  hurt and pain in this song, when I first heard it, it made my cry) Shame,  Back 2 Good (any song that has the guts to use a basson in it gets my vote)  and Hang.

This might be the best band of the  ""taking back sunday"" and ""jimmy eat world"" emo-punk-pop genre, but that aint saying much.  If your into this type of music, take a step back, take a deep breath, and buy The Kills' album, or the Black Keys, or Kings of Leon for something with real soul. Im getting sick of this kind of music featuring prepubescent teens whining about women and life in the most annoying and immature way possible.

If you hear some of Coheed's music and you don't like it, just keep listening to it, and YOU WILL be obsessed after awhile. BE PATIENT, and try to get into this, because THIS IS good music.",107,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000CD5FZ,"Coheed and Cambria are truly an amazing band. Their style is considered ""emo"", something that I am not too fond of. But this band is different. Claudio Sanchez is a master vocalist, with high pitch squeels to low end thunder drama that sends chills down anyone's neck. His guitar riffs are odd, yet suprisingly catchy. The lyrics tell a story of war, love, murder, and mystery. Joshua Eppard's drum chops bring the songs to life, with amazing dynamical refuge that seize every moment of this record. The technical difficulty of Travis Stever's guitar sound speak for itself, and Michael Todd brings it home with bass lines that will send even Jonathan Ruth to the principals office. In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3 showcases their wounderful talents and provides progressional rock anthems that will send your heart pounding with excitement. I recoment this album to anyone who is into Rush, Led Zepplin, The Flaming Lips, The Used, or any good rock music. Very well done.",164,3

I first herd about them from my sister who went to school with them, and the second I herd delerium trigger, I knew that they would take off. In keeping secrets is a perfect answer to second stage turbine blade. All the tracks have a great sound. There isn't a song that I don't like, but ""cuts marked in the march of men"" is my fav.

So one day, after being bored with what mainstream rock was feeding me, I gave my cousin a call and asked the name of that band.  Little did I know, after that phone call, that Coheed and Cambria would soon be my new favorite band.  At first when I heard CoCa associated with the term ""emo"", I thought about a bunch of whiny guys singing depressing music.  Boy was I wrong.  You need to own both of CoCa's cds (Second Stage Turbine Blade is the 1st I believe) because they are both awesome.  Coheed and Cambria are really skilled musical artists that don't get enough attention, though they are now starting to get more mainstream, whether you think that's a good thing or not I'll leave up to you.  I can't wait for their next CD coming out later this year.  I will definitely buy it and will definitely see these guys LIVE.  This is truly an amazing cd, I recommend you buy it TODAY!

Even if the vocals isn`t better than 'Good Apollo' or 'SSTB',even if the guitars,drums, base isn`t better than 'good apollo', this is still the best album ever. I don't know what makes it this good, it just is! Sometimes I think these guys come from another planet.

I was a big fan then, but with the release of In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth:3, I simply cannot contain my enthusiasm for these guys any longer. Coheed&Cambria paint a sinister epic saga through their songs. The lyrics are vivid, yet leave much to the imagination of the listener. The band has honed their sound and put together what I consider a breath of VERY fresh air in todays pop-driven manufactured-music scene. Kudos to Coheed&Cambria for simply writing the music they love to write, because I love to listen to it! May the next installment of the saga be as groundbreaking as the last two!",141,14

The third chapter of the series is a step up from the first two books.  The story is crisper and moves faster.  The book is still a little long - two much descriptive background that doesn't add to the narrative.  The reader doesn't need a description of a courtroom - Law and Order has educated the masses.

Yes the lead song ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" has a disco beat, but it's a great song; and again, Ace lets it rip on a great solo.  Peter Criss is pictured on the cover, but does not play on the album.  Anton Fig (of David Letterman's band) handles the drum work.  Because of Peter's  absence, ""technically"" you can't  consider this a ""Kiss"" record.  But setting that point aside,  ""Dynasty"" is the last great record Kiss ever made.  It's the great song writing and Ace's signature guitar that defines Kiss for me; and this is the last Kiss album where Ace really shines.",121,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"After licking their wounds from the solo disasters, KISS came back with ""Dynasty."" But this wasn't really a comeback as much as it was an unstable atom trying hard not to fracture. It kicks off with three rapid fire shots then falls apart quick.
""I Was Made For Loving You"" was pop disco as only KISS could have imagined it, and compared to most dance tracks fron that era, holds up rather well. Ace's reading of the Stone's ""2000 Man"" was proably his best moment on record as a singer. Finally, ""Sure Know Something"" was a great single that somehow got lost in the backlash that had formed around KISS.
Unfortunately the rest of the album gasses out from here. History tells us that internal strife and excess was beginning to tear the band apart by now; listening to ""Dynasty"" with that backstory behind it hints at why the remainder of the record sounds so uninspired.

The album I had back in the day had been long gone with maybe a few others that I loaned out and forgot about.  I just bought the remaster on CD and after watching KISSOLOGY, I must say, Dynasty was the end of what we all knew of KISS from back in the day.  This album finally gave Ace and Peter a bigger roll vocally, which I was glad to hear.  To me, it was about time that Gene shared the spotlight with Ace and Peter.  Paul is all good, no criticism there!  Dynasty is a group album, no one leads the way, it's shared and I'm glad to see\hear that.  I never listened to any new KISS after this.

By going along with the times. I quote Paul  Stanley... ""You could write this stuff in your sleep. If we can get a  hit doing this stuff, let's do it."" Of course I'm talking about the  awful 'I was made for loving you'. They play it live occasionally only for  nostalgia. The best tune on the album is by far Ace's version of 2000 man.  I also like 'Hard Times' also by the Jendellian visitor. The entire album  is basically soft pop, including Ace's which surprises me. After his  barnstorming solo effort, I thought he was ready to rock out with his  KISSmates. More than likely Gene and Paul had other plans for the band's  direction. Listen to 'Dynasty' then listen to 'Hotter than Hell', you can  barely tell it's the same band. This album was the beginning of the end for  KISS, the original lineup anyway. It wasn't until Creatures of the Night  that KISS got their heads out of their butts. Unfortunately, Ace and Peter  had left by then.",204,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"My all-time favorite Kiss album. Great re-packaging, which features original poster and album art. Love it!",16,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"WHYY???????????

This album sent Kiss into the gutters for years.  It was made for the wrong reasons.  Kiss was always the anti-disco and they did this.  I wouldn't recomend this album if your looking for rightous rock.

The only reason it deserves 1 star is because of Ace and his kick ass playing.",53,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"This is sort of a strange album for Kiss.  Following the success of the solo albums and ""Alive II"" Kiss was one of the biggest bands in the world.  But even the biggest band cannot live in a vacuum; by 1978 Disco was in full swing, and Kiss sought to take advantage of this by releasing ""Dynasty.""  Several of the tracks on this disc have a very Disco feel to them, particularly the intro track ""I Was Made For Loving You.""  Sadly, this foray into more modern music signaled a decline of sorts for Kiss, as their popularity waned somewhat from here on out.  That's not to say ""Dynasty"" is not a worthy Kiss album, just not one of their best.",121,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"Then it is one.  By this time in their career, they had lost most of their original audience by turning into a kiddie band.  Six year olds were at their shows with their mommies.  So what does doofus Gene do?  Turns them into a disco band!  Oh vey indeed.
Stick with everything up to Alive one, then forget the rest.  You won't miss anything.",64,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001ELL,"This album has gotten a lot of criticism. If I'd have been a little older & liked KISS prior to this I'd probably feel the same way those people do about it. It was a departure from what KISS had been doing. By this time the product marketing (toys, comic books, lunch boxes & so on) was out of control + the solo albums were promoted with a massive advertising campaign that turned off many fans. I even heard one fan say ""this isn't rock n roll""! So then comes ""I Was Made For Lovin You"", a disco flavored huge hit & more TV commercials promoting ""the return of KISS"". All this understood, I was young enough that I was attracted to the same ad campaign that turned off so many. I was, after all, the target audience. Years later I'm proud to say I'd end up liking KISS for the right reasons when I got a little older. This was my introduction though so maybe I'm bias but I think Dynasty is a great album. It remains one of my favorite KISS albums.",184,14
Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,Like being able to get it earlier than in bookstores.cheaper too! for a years subscription I would only be able to afford two of the print editing.am glad its available this way for people like me who like more indepth in their film coverage.,44,0
Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,Very entertaining and informative magazine for movie lovers. For me it just seem to get more expensive for this year and as I'm cutting back on subscription magazines this one I have to cut back on. Still a great magazine!,40,1
Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,"This magazine is great, very reminiscent of the old Premiere Magazine where in only movies and actors were discussed.  It has many in depth interviews and also rates upcoming movies and television.  Definitely worth the low price of $17.99 per year for Kindle subscription.",44,2

Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,"I like this magazine. I like the articles and the pictures from the sets of movies. I am only giving it 4 stars because the Kindle Fire version can be frustrating. Sometimes it can be hard to blow up pictures to get the full detail and other times the meaning of the picture is lost due to how it is presented in segments on the Kindle rather than as a whole in the glossy paper magazine. I love getting the Kindle version for its convenience, lightening fast delivery and smaller effect on the environment. But I do wish that they would fix the Kindle Fire format of the magazine so that it worked better.",114,9
Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,"The name says it all. Total Film is the only film magazine one needs for all the inside info on the latest Hollywood offerings. Unlike many entertainment industry journals, it focuses on the filmmaking process and leaves the star gossip column to lesser magazines. If you want to know the latest juicy info about your favorite star's sex life, look elsewhere. If you are a film fanatic and wish to read about Hollywood movies from concept to screen, then Total Film is for you.",84,10
Magazine_Subscriptions,B0079JCJRM,"It's always amazed me that the UK has two great movie magazines and the US has none. But I'm happy to subscribe and get Total Film here in the States.

There are two good UK film magazines: Empire and Total Film.  Empire tends to be more formal and serious while Total Film really has fun with the subject and in my opinion, a bit younger vibe.  I really love both and have subscriptions to each (one through Ipad and one through Kindle).

What I can say about the magazine is that these guys love movies and it shows in every section. Each issue has a wide variety of topics without all the highbrow elitism that was so prevalent in Premier magazine.  Yes, you can love Pacific Rim and Rosselini at the same time.

You get to try a month free with Kindle - I highly recommend checking it out.",149,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003TWP5NI,"The song selection is disappointing. So many songs that lend themselves to a more Celtic sense of the magic and mystery of Christmas were passed over in favor or Christmas bubblegum.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003TWP5NI,"Celtic Thunder doesn't disappoint with their beautiful and amazing mixture of sounds and this Christmas album is no exception.

From the soothing sounds of ""Silent Night"" (I think this is my favorite version of all time), to the tear-jerker ""Christmas 1915,"" to the upbeat sounds of ""I Wish It Could Be Christmas Every Day"" this is most certainly a musical delight that you don't want to miss.

This is dark-chocolate good, if you know what I mean!",77,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003TWP5NI,"I absolutely loved this CD! I ordered it through QVC when they had their Rose of Tralee song, and I must say that it took my breath away! I have been a fan of Celtic Thunder from the beginning, so I am perhaps a little biased, but I also absolutely love Christmas music. Tears were brought to my eyes in several of the songs, especially Silent Night and Our First Christmas Together.

On Celtic Thunder Christmas, you can hear some of the classics(Silent Night, Winter Wonderland, etc) but also some newer classics(Baby, It's Cold Outside) as well as some Phil Coulter originals(Our First Christmas Together and Christmas Morning Donegal). I was definitely not disappointed by this CD. I believe it is noteworthy to include that on Baby, It's Cold Outside, is a duet with Ryan and a woman whose name I do not know.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"I bought this CD within 24 hours after seeing the movie years ago. I pretty well wore it out playing it in my car and singing along with it. So, I had to buy a new copy. I'm usually not a fan of compilations, but this collection of songs is really well-done. The Steve Earle song, Me and the Eagle, is worth the price of the album itself, as are the songs by Lucinda Williams, Iris Dement, Gillian Welch, and Emmylou Harris, but they are all on the same album! Plus, there are great songs by the Mavericks, the Flatlanders, George Strait, and on and on. Just a great album.",110,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"What a great concept, to have an album of songs inspired by a movie!  Though only a couple of these songs were actually in the movie, they all ""feel"" comfortable and familiar, though I'd never heard them  before.  Reminiscent of the lonesome but contented feel of Tom Booker and  his ranch.  Great western sounds, more traditional than what I hear on the  radio lately.  I enjoy the different sounds to the voices, sad and crying  sometimes, independent and glad of it other times.  Good mix of vocal  ranges.  Great album for an evening in front of a roaring fire.",99,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"The movie was a huge disappointment...at least 30 minutes too long, desperately in need of editing, and spending way too little time on the ""horse whispering"" and too much on ""people whining."" However, this collection of ""country and western"" songs ""inspired by"" the script (and a couple that actually got into the film) is a winner. Every performer on here does a good job with a worthy song. Unlike the movie, the soundtrack may even be too short, considering its quality. Good  balance of styles within a genre, of male and female voices, of sad and happy tunes.  Steve Earle does a nice Dylan imitation on his number, only with better diction than Bob could manage.",116,3

Thank you to Robert Redford; for reminding us all of the wonderful, spiritual feelings of the ""old"" style country music and life-style.  The huge mountains and farm lands that I miss so dearly.  Thank you for bringing me back to my 'roots' that I am not afraid or ashamed to admit that I love.  Too bad this world has gotten so far away from the simple things, the beautiful....real...things in life.  Nothing fake or plastic here.  Life is made to be loved again...thank you for this wonderful CD!!",100,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,I loved the movie and the soundtrack was wonderful. I only wish that i could access the end title song because i think it is awesome.

I wish i could still have the time to ride and race again and the movie lets me remember the good times.,68,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006EJH,"I was disappointed in the CD thinking that I would get nothing but the soundtrack. I feel the description did not indicate that all songs were not from the movie and that is why I was very disappointed. I purchased it for a friend as a gift and they live in Canada. They too were surprised and disappointed. Because of logistics, we are not going to bother to return it. It would cost much more just shipping it back and forth to each other. The description needs to be more descriptive and state that all songs are NOT from the soundtrack. In going back to the site to see what I did wrong, I find I am also rather puzzled why the original score is $49???Is it that limited?",129,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"This is one of my favourite albums of all time.

The production by the Dust Brothers (Beastie Boys Pauls Boutique, Beck Odelay) is uncluttered but very tasteful. It is mostly sample based with the occasional Drum Machine or Bass played by Flea (Red Hot Chilli Peppers) and vocals by N'Dea Davenport (Brand New Heavies), but all the songs parts fit so well, it could have been created from scratch. Tones vocals glide smoothly over top and no, he's not trying to change the world, but he brings humour and a relaxed feel to the strong production.

The album did take me a couple of listens when I first got it in 1990 but the more I listened the more I liked it.

It has a distinctive groove and is very easy to listen to.",134,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,This is a very good album period. Great beats to all the songs and tone loc has a very original and good voice. The lyrics are pretty good to and it just makes you relax.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"I was about 10 years old when this album came out and I thought it was great at the time. I recently bought it so I could take a trip down memory lane and it was really a lot better in my memories than it is in reality. There's not a lot of creativity to his songs. He does have a unique voice, though. There are a couple of songs I guess I will probably listen to now and again for nostalgic reasons, i.e. Funky Cold Medina and Wild Thing, but overall, meh.",93,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000006C7Y,"Tone-Loc burst onto the scene in early 1989 with the now classic ""Wild Thing"". The song sampled Van Halen's ""Jamie's Crying"" and had a video that clipped the style of the iconic ""Addicted To Love"" and featuring Loc's gravelly voice, the song soared up the pop charts to number 2.  The album climbed even further making it to number one becoming just the second album by a hip-hop artist to do as such.  The album also features Loc's ode to Spanish Fly which is a tongue-in-cheek rap that uses a ton of samples most notably Foreigner's ""Hot Blooded"".  It rose to number 3 on the pop charts.  The rest of the album is fun, but nothing is a memorable as the hit singles.  ""Cuttin' Rhythms"" does have a fantastic break sampling ""Band on The Run"" and ""The Homies"" pays tribute to his boys in the hood.",146,6

The various characters were enjoyable and the various new technology was great. The ""elite"" group of humans chosen to be enhanced to cope with the aliens and slow them down was good fun

The 2 alien species were good and as often indulged the ""Area 51"" conspiracy people combined with the ultimate twist.

Kindle_Store,B00EOEGFNO,"Quite a good action packed story. Slow build up and ever increasing tension, somewhat unique story line. Good twists and turns in the plot that didn't telegraph where it was going. Good characters albeit on the thin side. The tech is believable but never examined in detail, which is just fine. All in all a very good first book by a new author, well done. Some of the things that keep it from being a 5 star effort are; some cheesy dialog at times, some sequences and descriptions should have been done in more detail, and others were overdone. The author needs to keep a close eye on showing the story more, and keep the tell in check.

I'll definitely buy a sequel, but the author needs to rethink his pricing if he wants exposure. I would have passed on this book at the $6 price in a heartbeat if I hadn't exhausted every other possibility for a quick purchase among the new authors.  $1.99 to $2.99 is where it needs to be if he wants to get known quickly.",180,8

then bring a super enhanced human (beating all the superheros)

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"If you are a genuine lover of music, whether it be classical, dance, rock, or whatever - you will undoubtedly be impressed by the talent which has produced this excellent piece of work. Track four - 'Ageispolis' is one of my all time favourite tracks - it is just so unusual and enchanting. This particular track is ambient, but has a sound through it which makes the whole room vibrate while still being relaxing!!?? Very cleverly done. If you have other Aphex Twin albums, but find them a bit 'mad' or even scary, then don't worry because this one is different and is very calm and unobtrusive. I used to put my stereo on quiet and go to sleep with this playing some nights. It is one of the few albums I have considered getting a second copy of just incase this one gets damaged. One last note - if you read the other reviews, you will see that the artist has a strong international fan base and, although the music is a million miles from being 'mainstream', many, many people have been affected in a positive way by this thought inspiring musical genius and have realised that it is truly something special.",203,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,I think this is a pretty good cd but I must say that I think it would only suit someone who has a like for ambient/electronic music ..... I don't see this appealing to wider audience.,36,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"This album is one of a small cluster of electronia records designed for listening and reflection. This inspires music that aims for the scope of a symphony orchestra, and the subtle emotional ripples of great piano-trio jazz. Listen on headphones to fully appreciate the bubbling and bright possibilities of this album.",51,2

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"To think he was 14 when he started making this! The best ambient music. Almost 20 years old but sounds timeless. Highlights: Xthal, ageispolis, heliosphan, we are the music makers, ptolemy, green calx. Very recommended, and a must have for any Aphex fan.",43,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"Very nicely done CD. Wonderful ambient/IDM style music- well worth the money. Been a proud owner of this CD for a while, now, and listen to it often, when I'm in the mood for this sort of music. Definately a worthy addition to anyone's IDM collection. Possibly even a 'standard' of any IDM collection. Aphex Twin knows how to do it, and do it RIGHT.",65,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"This is one of Aphex Twin's earliest works, some people find it hard to believe that these tracks could've been made by someone as young as our Mr. James but, that's irrelevant. SAW1 is a collection of some of his best work  and is the missing link between his polygon window and Aphex Twin aliases.
The album captures the true essence of his work, simple melodies which  build with other sounds to form layered musical masterpieces. The  production is raw and at some times even poor but, this adds tremendous  character to the album - I would recommend you turn off those woofers!
As for the songs, the first 2 are fantastic chilled tunes, they drift  like dead astronauts through space. The third was used recently by Gary  Rhodes on his cookery programme (hmmm!). Green Calx is a pseudo-miami bass  masterpiece which you are thoroughly not expecting after the subtle Eno  ambience of the previous track. He samples Gene Wilder to good effect in  'We are the music makers'. Ptolemy and Delphium provide the MTV at 2am feel  and are probably best heard at that time (you'll see.......!).
Buy this.",190,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"AMAZING album!  This is a classic, full of tracks that can pull anybody into a metaphysical trance.  If you are into the ""chill"" genre, this is right up your alley. Get it.",32,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,Its too bad this cd isn't readily available to the public.  James' throws 13 awesome tracks down in the first volume of ambient works.  The netherworldly sounds on tracks Tha and Hedphelym seem to come from inside  James' mind... Inside that mind of his is the inner workiings of sheer  genious... no other artist can combine the ambient sounds of electronics  with the seemingly enless sounds of space. Aphex Twin takes you to an  amazingly beautiful place in your own mind... where aural pleasure is your  own god.... worship the Twin.,91,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,Heard Xtal on a college radio station back in the early 2000's and was instantly addicted to the soundscapes on this album. I have probably listened to this album more than any other album that i have ever brought. Managed to score a Reissue on vinyl which isn't bad since the price for the original goes for $80 on Discogs. I highly recommend this album if you are looking to explore in the vast world of music.,77,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"I really like the first half of this album a lot, but the last half just seems to run together (Especially the last 3 songs). Every song on this CD would be considered ambient, excluding Green Calx, which is still a very good song.

If your a fan of Aphex Twin, I'd Reccomend buying this.",55,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"I think that in order to appreciate the true value of this breezy  collection of Richard James' greatest ambient experiments, you need to turn  the volume down.  Way down.  This is not a ""rave"" CD, as some may  suggest.  It is music that is best enjoyed sitting in a room in front of  two evenly-spaced speakers connected to a decent stereo set at a mid-low  volume.  So rarely do we approach music as a complete experience--it often  serves as the backdrop to a social event or a workplace, or provides  ""filler"" to an otherwise silent space.  Selected Ambient Works  85-92 is not for dancing, driving, or doing dishes.  It is for listening,  in the same way one thoughtfully stops to listen in earnest to birds that  have been chirping all the while, or to classical music at a symphony.  The  music was created with this kind of attention, and the listener must listen  in kind to truly appreciate James' magic.",160,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"Though Aphex Twin's ""Selected Ambient Works: 85-92"" is primarily an ambient piece, it actually has some great appeal. Songs like ""Xtal"", ""Tha"" and ""Pulsewidth"" are incredibly relaxing and soothing pieces (ambient classics!). The electronic noises are superb - you'll love most every song on this album. There are no voice samples here; everything is digital. Every song, except for ""Green Calx"" (which is kind've interesting) is, essentially, an ambient masterpiece (though ""Ptolemy"" is more energetic and less ambient). If you're looking for an incredibly relaxing album then ""Selected Ambient Works: 85-92"" is a very very good purchase (along with B12's ""Electro-Soma"", The Orb's ""Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld"" and Boards Of Canada's ""Music Has The Right To Children""). Highly recommended!

Highlights include:
everything except for ""Green Calx""",126,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"A great album for dance parties. This album has some really nice dance rythems and sounds, with a twist of techno. If you like dance it is good. If you like techno it is even better.",36,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000005RHR,"Ok, I admit that I'm partial to Richard D. James, but this album is absolutely flawless. While musically his stuff has always been advanced, this CD really bridges the gap between his usually ""weird"" (to  the casual listener) sounding works and danceable, poppy music. Where in  later releases James eventually adapted a more blip-bleep, frantic  breakbeat style, in SAW 85-92 every single track is organic and lush  sounding. The major difference between SAW 85-92 and SAW Volume II (for all  you non-RDJ/Aphex Twin fans, SAW Volume II is a later released double  album) is that SAW 85-92 is layered with catchy pop hooks and clubby  industrial beats. Think Orb's ""Little Fluffy Clouds"", except more  aggressive, less vocal samples, and more variation. Almost every track  (almost, not all) has a steady beat and is danceable - this isn't Brian Eno  ambience, but ambient techno. While it's not exactly chill room music, it's  perfect at the end of a long party when everyone's tired and ready to  collapse. Brilliant, and a must listen.",171,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"This is one of the best metal albums of all time.  It has catchy riffs and break-neck drum beats that stand up to any Power Metal album ever made.  If you don't already own this album, stop wasting your time reading this and place an order.",46,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"This is the foundation where ALL Speed Metal started at.

So many Metal bands were started from this one CD.

The next 2 CDs after this one were the foundations of all Power Metal.

So many Metal bands were started from those 2 CDs as well.

(That's the history that CD).

(The music itself).  Kai Hansen's singing is a little off here and there, but the guitar work is outstanding, and this is kick-you-in-your-face and take no prisoners Metal.

Helloween would never be this heavy ever again, even until today.

This was before Michael Kiske came into the band.  He would come into the band on the next CD that came after this one.

Also, if you like the ""Helloween EP"" and ""Walls of Jericho"" CD, DEFINITELY make sure you get the ""Batallions of Fear"" CD and ""Follow the Blind"" CD from Blind_GuardiaN.

Those 2 Blind_GuardiaN CDs are a direct clone / exact replica of the ""Helloween EP"" and ""Walls of Jericho"" CD from Helloween.  Even Kai Hansen sings some on the ""Follow the Blind"" CD from Blind_GuardiaN.",178,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"This is one of the many reasons why I gave the middle finger to Heavy metal and started listening to innovative Death metal albums like Death's ""Symbolic"" and Celtic frost's ""Into the pandemonium"". It's nothing but the same damn power chord usage and sing along verses and choruses. Kai Hansen sounds like he was casterated to keep his absurdly high pitched voice and the drummer uses the same old double bass technique. This is for old, old school metalheads who refuse to grow and branch out into new territory. Check out Blind guardian's ""Imaginations from the other side"" for quality Power metal. Go listen to Hypocrisy's ""The fourth dimension"" if you want a diverse, unconventional (otherwise known as ""false"" metal) piece of music.
P.S.-Anyone who considers this definative 80's German metal needs to listen to Kreator's ""Pleasure to kill"", Sodom's ""Persecution mania"", and Destruction's ""Sentence of death/Infernal overkill"". Those guys make Helloween look like a bunch o' nancys. Metal heart signing out now.",163,2

Mind you, this is not the silky-smooth Michael Kiske or Andy Deris fronted Helloween, this is the speed metal/borderline thrash Kai Hansen fronted Helloween.  Somewhat roughly produced, with Kai's nasal vocals, I have heard it takes some people awhile to ""get"" this album.  I don't understand those people, I guess.  There is nothing here but blazing melodic riffs, screaming vocals, winnowing bass and pounding drums.  I challenge you to listen to ""Ride the Sky"" or ""Victims of Fate"" and not snap your neck head-banging or blow out an ACL rocking down with your air-guitar.  Oh, and the guitar solo's are a thing of majesty, words cannot do them description accurately.  Just get yourself that new two-disc re-issue of this, quickly!",150,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"Helloween's Walls Of Jericho shows the real importance of Kai Hansen in the band. All the fast riffs, the ""epic"" choruses...all of what Helloween was about was because of Kai Hansen. So, there's no surprise in finding Gamma Ray's albums very similar to Walls Of Jericho, and of course, if you like GammaRay, you'll like this one.",57,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,This is an amazing album.  The first Helloween album I ever heard was Dark Ride.  This album is much darker and more powerful.  If you like speed metal or thrash this album is a must buy.  Probably their best.  The newer albums seem toned down a little bit.  I suggest this album and both Keeper albums as well as Dark Ride and Rabbit Dont Come Easy.  Helloween is definately one of the most underrated bands around today.  If you like metal or shred pick this album up!!!,87,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"Helloween's debut is more of a thrash-metal vein than their more melodic ""Keeper"" albums.  This isn't a bad thing at all - the album is full of great guitar and driving rhythms, a bit more metal and less melodic-rock than the next four albums.  The main difference, though, is that while the following albums would have the more melodic singing of Michael Kiske, here guitarist Kai Hansen is on vocals.  While I really like Kai's singing in Gamma Ray (in fact, I prefer it to any vocals in Helloween), on this album he has a really harsh, unpleasant tone to his voice.  (Mind you, Helloween's longest running and current singer Andi Deris does, too, but he's a bit better than Kai here).  If you like the vocals of Deris or Motorhead's Lemmy, this probably won't bother you, but I find the vocals on this album (and, to a lesser degree the Deris-era)  kind of grate on my ears, and I'm not always in the mood for it.  The music itself is maybe a little less polished than later albums, but has that first album/underground-metal charm.",185,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"This album is very different than anything Helloween has put out ever since. But this, in my opinion is their gem. This is straight up Speed metal, and its damn right amazing. The guitars are so melodic, the bass makes my skin crawl, and the pounding drums just make the whole sound elevate to a next level. On Walls of Jericho, you get to hear Kai Hansen singing his brains out and he does an amazing job at it. ""Ride the Sky"" is one of the most amazing songs I have ever heard, the guitars are really melodic. ""reptile"" has always been one of my favorites, on the chorus part, you can hear the bass follow Kai's voice, that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up! ""Heavy Metal is the law"" has got to be the coolest Heavy Metal anthem ever, this song would make even Man O War bow down to them. In short, you have to get this album to understand why so many years after its release, it is still regarded as one of the best speed metal albums ever. (The review on the bottom is also me, only that first I had done it anonymous).",203,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"Helloween are pretty much known as the originators of Power Metal, largely due to this and the two Keeper Of The Seven Keys albums.  Walls Of Jericho is a melodic, fast, rip-roarin' metal album, that at first listen you could easily call Thrash.  While it can easily hold it's own in the speed department against the Thrash bands of the time, it's obvious there's something else going on here.  Because it sounds a lot like Iron Maiden too!  So what the hell do we call this stuff?  That's Power Metal, kids, here in it's purest form.
Unfortunately it's a tad underrated, and I always felt it should be one of those ""required reading"" metal albums.  The Keeper albums are(and rightly so), but Jericho should be tacked onto those two albums as well, though the sound is a bit different from those albums-more raw and thrashy.
NO ONE sounded like Helloween.  These guys were(still are)a very original, talented and extraordinary band.  Checks out Walls and see where it started.",168,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"Back when this album came out, I remember how some publications slagged it off by saying HELLOWEEN were ripping off METALLICA and IRON MAIDEN. Funny to see, some 20 years later, that their brand of Heavy Metal is the most aped formula in the Epic/Power Metal movement. Back in 1985, HELLOWEEN were a Thrash band with a huge knack for writing memorable melodies and devastating thrash riffs and harmonies. Unlike fellow German thrashers like DESTRUCTION or KREATOR, HELLOWEEN preserved a lot of traditional metal in their DNA, with virtually no punk or hardcore overtones (except, maybe, the frantic pace of most of the songs here in).

""Ride The Sky"", ""Heavy Metal is the Law"" and the thrashing closer, ""How many tears"" are staples of speed/thrash metal. The vocals of Kai Hansen will please MAIDEN fans and the drumming of Ingo (R.I.P.), with its frenzied double bass mayhem, will surely please most thrashers.

The album has lost NONE of its impact and in no way does this sound dated (this is, after all, power metal defined!).

Do yourselves a favor and buy this album right now!!!",185,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006LI26,"The vocals are a bit scratchy and hard to understand, but this album is totally brillaint. There isn't a single track on it that I don't like. It's harder than Helloween's later CDs for sure; this may be a good or bad thing depending on the person. When you want something with nonstop metal power, this is the CD to get. The inclusion of an entire separate EP and a bonus track in addition to the original album makes it that much better.
This is definitely going to become one of my favorite CDs.",94,13

It sounds like it was thrown together really quick to meet the season. George sings with no emotion, which is rare, and if I did not no better I would think that he was Jewish.

Kindle_Store,B00L9FY2U4,"This book has obviously been heavily edited recently. Reading through other reviews, I was like WTF are they talking about?!
I don't think I have ever had such rollercoaster emotions while reading (no, actually devouring) a book. I was less than 4% in when the tears started. Not long after that I was shuffling around in my chair, feeling the sex coursing through me. So many emotions...anger, joy, hope, despair to name a few.
I must admit, Sawyer isn't my favourite leading character. There's a weakness and vulnerability to him that I just can't handle. His loyalty to his big brother in the majority of the book goes beyond bounds. He confused me. I struggled to get a handle on his age...I'm assuming closer to 30, but he had something about him that just led my mind to picture him as a lot younger.
I liked the storyline. It was quite predictable but then I guess it wouldn't be a romance if there wasn't a HEA.
I really enjoyed the mixed POV, particularly the little section from Olivia.
All in all this is a good debut book and I urge those of you read it PRE edit to give it another go!",202,12

Kindle_Store,B00KL13UYQ,Book 3 of a trilogy and yet its still a self contained book.  Reading the previous stories do add characters depth and some story line extra information but its not mandatory to read to enjoy this book.

At the same time, Rafael LaCroix pursues her as his mate but Pinky thinks he is crazy. Will she give in to her desires? I really enjoyed the Crane Curse series though you could read each as a stand-alone it is more powerful to read all 3 to learn the intricacies of the curse and how everyone interconnects. It's also just great writing by Liliana Rhodes so jump in and enjoy!",128,7

I am sad to see the end.  I had hoped that the Cranes and the strange town of Leeds Point would go on indefinitely, but alas it is only a trilogy which from the end of the book tells me that a spin off will occur.

I enjoyed getting to know the Cranes, the various shifters involved and am happy that all ended well.

I look forward to A Wolf at the Door coming sometime this summer(2014) if I remember the title and proper dates my memory just isn't what it used to be.

She is on a mission to find him, but the local alpha insists she be accompanied. This is Raphael and Pinky's story, which unwinds around a mysterious disappearance and a murderous shifter. While the story can be followed without reading the first two books in the series, I recommend you read them all in order.  The Crane Curse unravels throughout the three books; you may miss nuances if you only read the last book.  It is a great series, and I hope the author will write future books that include this town and characters.  I loved the series and do not want to say goodbye to the characters.",139,14

His knowledge about Satan and Grace are unsurpassed.
If you want to really understand Erwin Lutzger's books Hitler's Cross, When a Nation Forgets God and Oprah, Miracles, and the New Earth, read Dr. Chafer's book Satan - His Motives and Methods.  It really sheds light on the satanic influence behind all 3 of those books.
Chafer's book Grace - An Exposition of God's Marvelous Gift is a phenomenal explanation of all that God's grace entails.  A must read.
Since they are still under copyright, this does not include his Systematic Theology or the book Major Bible Themes.  These are worth the effort to acquire and read.  Major Bible Themes is really a summary of everything else that he wrote.",138,8

I just received the 8 volume series only 3 weeks ago so this is a process which should take quite some time as it's a study and not just a read.  They used to teach this in the Dallas Seminary.

He just doesn't do it on this album.  Besides swing low, every song is the same whiny 14 year old girl BS that every other band on the radio sounds like.  What a waste of talent.  Save yourself the money and just listen to any other whiny non-original music that has dominated the ""rock"" stations for the past 5 years.  I thought I was going to hear a more blues/rock kind of stuff but they are exactly like everyone else.",108,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"I, like most Rocco Deluca and The Burden fans, first heard about them on their VH1 documentary ""I Trust You To Kill Me"" (which I also reccomend you buy, it allows you to understand the music even better) and I was extreamly impressed by their talent. Their CD of the same name is absolutely AMAZING!!! It's been years since I have heard music that has come from such an orginal artistic point of view. Every song is beautiful!!! I promise if you buy this CD it will be in your CD player for months, you won't be able to stop listening to it!!!!",103,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"Wow, this is ONE GREAT CD.  Do yourself a big favor and BUY IT NOW.  You can thank me later after you've played it 20-times in a row and are looking forward to the 21st.  Original song writing, vocals, musicianship, production (cheers to Jude Cole), song arrangement and red hot single called Colorful (check out the video on VH1)!

The flow of the CD makes you feel like you just sat through a concert.  There are classic rockers like Colorful, How Fast, Gravity and Soul mixed with some beautiful acoustic numbers like Bus Ride and Mystified.  The majority of the CD is rock.  There are a couple of songs that have a blues feel like Swing Low.

Rocco Deluca's dad was a touring guitar player with some of the best blues artists in the business.  Rocco followed in his footsteps backing up greats like Taj Mahal, John Mayall, John Lee Hooker and Johnny Cash.  Needless to say he's been groomed his whole life to do this and it all comes together on this CD.",174,2

I love Swing Low and I am blown away everytime I listen to Soul--this track along makes it worth to cost of the CD with Rocco's amazing guitar work being backed up by Jude Cole (an excellent musician himself) on guitar and keyboard. I look forward to hearing more from Rocco and Ironworks for a long time.",72,4

I have listened to it in different places, moods, and came back to it again and again hoping that it would grow on me. However, do not buy this cd - it will be wasted money. It is less than average. I would rather take a chance picking a cd blindly out of a used box of cd's. The music is bland at best, has no originality, and I can only conclude that the great reviews are from friends of the band. Or as the reviews would suggest, K. S. fans. Give yourself and your ears a break - do not waste your time.",119,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"I saw this band perform on one of the late shows, and I was not impressed.  However, I purchased the cd, hoping that my first impression was incorrect.  It was.

Rocco and his Burden deliver a unique, original album full of songs that are perfect for any situation, be it a party, or just kicking back to relax.  They really show their ability in an interesting array of tracks, ranging from twangy and almost country to alternative rock.

Must-hears on this album are Track #4, Bus Ride, and Track #9, Mystified.  Fantastic!!",92,8

Jude Cole's delivering Rocco into our arms to hold close and savor his heart-felt melodies made me want to weep and dance for joy at the same time--Real Music, to continue singing a kinship to the Soul of good people everywhere! I look forward to more of Jude Cole, Rocco, and Ironworks Music!!",94,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"I saw Rocco Deluca & the Burden when they opened for Robert Randolph &  the Family Band, and I was blown away. Rocco's live show is incredible, I was entranced by every song, and this is atypical because usually, I don't really enjoy performances unless I am at least familiar with the music of the artist. The passion in the performance and the voice of this band blew me away. So I excitedly purchased the cd. After listening to the studio CD, however I was disappointed. The power of the live show of this band did not translate, and the music sounds like something i've heard before, instead something to be excited about. The CD is still very good, and I would suggest buying it, because lyrically it is very mature, and the use of the dobro resonator guitar is very different.

Some of the highlights include the songs Favor, Soul, and Dope.

If you have the opportunity however see them live. Then you will see why their first CD is only the beginning.",174,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,I really enjoyed hearing a kind of old school sound with a touch of modern edge. Rocco's voice is what gets me. I love it. I really enjoy the hearty feeling to some of the tracks and how it builds into an explosion of sound. The only downfall to the cd is that it's kinda all over the place with the overall vibe. I felt like he was trying too hard to show all of the stuff he can do.,80,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,This is the best music I have heard in a very long time.  A refreshing blend of the modern with undertones of blues and other genres of music. Well worth the money.,32,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"Regardless of the hype involving Keifer Sutherland and late night tv appearances for this number, I expect a good album to affect me in a way independent of label or connection.  I begrudgingly admit this one does.  From the first track on through the entirety, I was surprised by the dexterity of a rather humbly broadcasted CD.  The Burden and Co. are fairly new, but the appeal is broad.  It's a breathy mix of Coldplay, Incubus, and a bit of old word Indie sound that makes a good sing along as well as a disc I could excitedly say, ""Here, listen!"" without later being embarrassed.  None of the songs come off as filler and the variety in melody and approach keep it from being bland or like six bowls of similar musical soup.  I would gladly recommend this to someone looking for a mellow experimental sound mixed with tremulous effect and raw talent and bark at them to snatch this up.  It's well worth the minutes spent hearing it.",169,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009O1E3E,"This is one of the best albums I've purchased in the last couple years. The album successfully blends different genres and makes it all ""work.""

I highly recommend that no human being spend their hard earned money on this trash, although Laffy Taffy is a catchy song, it is highly overrated. This group simply cannot rap, they use the overused subjects in their songs present in most modern day rap music, such as degrading women, having bling bling, getting money, sex, etc. Not only this group can't rap, but the music sounds very cheap. The dollar store must have had a super sale on keyboards when this was recorded. If this album were a film it would definitely be the straight-to-video or made-for-cable kind. Bottom Line: Poor rapping, simplistic lyrics, and cheap-sounding music. You have been warned!!!",135,5

It seems that as Alanis has grown as an artist that she has lost the strained high-pitched moan that came at the end of many of her lyrics on ""Jagged Little Pill."" I praise Alanis for such a fantastic piece of work and cannot wait to see her on the ""Under Rug Swept"" tour.",86,0

Every single song has its own charm to embrace, and you can listen to them over and over and never get tired of them. Alanis' strongpoint has always been in her lyrics, and I love to sing along with this CD.
My favourite songs are the first four: ""21 Things That I Want In a Lover"": because it's fun and the lyrics are great, sometimes you even have to laugh. ""Narcissus"" is cheeky and upbeat. Obviously I have to include ""Hands Clean"", this album's reminiscent single. And ""Flinch"", being on the slower side, stills bears a positive message. Another good song is ""Surrendering"".

Don't be put off by Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie's not so hot reviews, it wasn't well received, but 'Under Rug Swept' in in some ways a back to basics album with great melodies, thought provoking lyrics that make u smile with recognition of having the same thoughts and feelings in your own past relationships. If you're looking for a reason to come back to Alanis, this is it. a Fantastic album.",141,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"This is truly some of Alanis's best work. the album hardly has a bad track. each track is a strong as the other, and this was the case with her jagged little pill album. my favourite alanis album is suppossed former infatuation junkie, because alanis was completely original on that record. but under rug swept is definately one of her best so buy it.
you won't regret it
HIGHLIGHTS: 21 things, so unsexy, precious illusions, hands clean, narcissus, a man, u owe me nothing, surrendering, utopia!",86,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"Even the first time I listened to this album I was hardly impressed. ""You Owe Me Nothing"" is the only song that sounded somewhat origonal and interesting. As for the rest of the album, it's either too pop, or too dull.

 Amazing, though, how the music videos, that were made to promote Under Rug Swept, were still original. Whereas with the release of Alanis's newest cd So Called Chaos, the videos are cheesey (judging by Alanis's music video for Everything).",80,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"""under rug swept"" is a really amazing disc. morissette has taken production control and created a musical set with complex, sometimes hysterical lyrics and a rhythm focused, guitar-heavy melody. absent is the frenetic musical experimentation that was ""supposed former infatuation junkie"" and in its place is a more cohesive and structured album.
...the angry girl depiction has become such a media and critic's cliche. on ""under rug swept"" she doesn't so much rant at men as she describes her own place in these dysfunctional relationships...beautifully written, these songs may sound like stream-of-consciousness poetry, but at least they're thought provoking and delivered with great vocal finesse...it's about style, baby, and morissette's hook is the vocal and linguistic game of tag that she plays throughout her songs.
ripped vocals and sexy melodies wrap themselves nicely around morissette's writing, making this a truly wonderful disc. ""21 things i want in a lover"",""hands clean"" and ""you owe me nothing in return"" are three of her strongest tracks to date and alone make the album worth owning...just check out this album.",176,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"I like the album.  Yup, it has a different style/sound from Jagged little pill, but that's part of the fun of following a musician's career.  Sit back, listen, and enjoy the journey they take us on!  If every album sounded the same, *then* I would say a musician wasn't growing.",50,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"I really think this is Alanis`s best work, i absolutley loved it!!! JLP and SFIJ where GREAT, but the songs in this album are amazing... her voice, but especially the lyrics are mesmerizing. My favorites are ""21 things..."", ""Flinch"", ""Hands clean"", but especially ""That particular time"". Other songs like ""Utopia"" and ""So unsexy"" are so very powerfull. I think there isn`t a songwriter as great as Alanis, my best friend and I love her, we have all of her cds...We just hope that her next studio album does not makes us wait too much... SHE`S DEFINETELY A GIFTED ARTIST!!!!",99,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"After hearing the terrific songs ""So Unsexy"" and ""Hands Clean"" on the radio, I rushed out and bought what I hoped would be a smart, energetic, insightful CD. What I discovered instead was Alanis Morrissette basically recycling the same music she used on her ""Jagged Little Pill"" CD. Only this time, her lyrics are more obtuse, less accessible, and less compelling. There are a few bright spots on the CD, such as the songs I mentioned. But, overall, the CD is rather negligible and self-involved. I believe only die-hard fans of Morrissette's will get any real mileage out of this vapid collection. (Ironically enough, I purchased Lisa Loeb's new CD ""Cake & Pie"" the same day I bought this one, and that CD surprised me by being the musically superior to Morrissette's effort. So if you want some great new chick rock, check out that title.)",146,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"I'm not sure I'd suggest this album for those who loved her previous albums but for hard core fans it has it's moments.  She used to be my favorite artist until I got this album, it's just not full of her characteristic ""I hate the world and everyone in it"" attitude I fell in love with.  If you're looking for something more positive an up beat, check this one out!  If not, I'd listen to the samples above before spending your money.  You never know, you may like it anyhow!",90,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"One thing that has surprised me about Alanis is that she has maintained her artistic integrity -- this is quite a thing to do in an era when WB/Time/AOL regularly makes hit records by profiling songs on Smallville. (ironically Swept is published by Warner! heheh)...Alanis's lyrics are easily undertood. Her syntax and phrasing are not faulty -- in fact her singing is part of a distinctly Canadian performance style. (Our Lady Peace is a good example). If you want easy listening pick up a GoGos album.
As for her stream-of-consciousness songs, this is something unique and rare. Alanis is baring her soul in the way that best fits her own personality...This album deserves five stars. Alanis broke the mold with her first album. Her newest release proves why she is the most impressive female rocker of the last decade - she has more consistency, creativity, integrity, and passion ...",149,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"As with her previous project, Alanis has once again shown that she is growing both as an artist and as a person.  The angry white female ""recovering"" from childhood and a series of bad relationships is perhaps even less present on this album then on the follow-up to Jagged Little Pill.  Alanis once again delivers with her unique ability to combine melodic riffs and enchanting hooks with powerful lyrics that will stay swiming in your head long after you are done listening.  Perhaps the only negative is that the stream of consciousness lyrical style is a little difficult to keep up with at times as it has a tendancy to babble a bit.",113,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005TPKC,"Being a long-time Alanis Morissette fan and after waiting for 3 and 1/2 years for a new studio recording, the first thing I did today was run out and buy her new album. It was definitely worth the wait! She is an amazing artist  and has, once again, proven her worth as an extremely talented musician. Her lyrics are poignant, touching and brutally honest. Her journies of self-discovery have helped me through some of my most heart-breaking experiences. Once again, she has given me a wonderful album of incredible music and gut-wrenching honesty. Thanks for sharing yourself with us, Alanis! You're amazing!",102,14

Independent authors have enough of an uphill battle against big name publishers, readers shouldn't bash them for slight typos that DO NOT take away from the story at all!

Kindle_Store,B00EKOCABE,"Stories about the Old West including those about mail order brides have always been interesting and some of my favorites. This book was terrible. Did the five star reviewers and I even read the same book??

There was zero character development, the story was all over the place and a nightmare to try and read. It was filled with childish writing, short, choppy sentences and in serious need of a proofreader. The poor excuse for a bedroom scene was just that. I agree with another reviewer who wondered how it ever got published.",93,5

For new people thinking of reading this Start with the Admiral Who book first, you need to get the lingo and base story down so the rest makes sense. It reads fast and easy.

Kindle_Store,B00KAP9B7S,"This is a spin off of the authors brothers Admiral series which has gone from a fun adventure to something complex, multi-stranded and rapidly becoming a epic opus in scope. It could largely be read on it's own if you're not familiar with the core books but best combined with them.

And this starts as a good palate cleanser with a more focused story that introduces some excellent new characters to the universe. But as the series develops (The forth book, ""McKnight's Mission: A House Divided"", which is the start of the second trilogy has just been published) it become less of a diversion and more of a stand alone, ""Universe in mortal peril"" story that impacts it's bigger brother.

Excellent ship to ship battle, series ground pounding action with the author brave enough loose major characters during them ensures real tension and a sense of risk when it matters all combine to deliver on a satisfying book and a great series to get into.",165,6

(2) The inclusion of 10+ minute ""Achilles Last Stand"" from the weakest record, 'Presence' (1976), could have been replaced with 2-3 much better, more memorable songs from other records (""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""The Ocean"", ""Dancing Days"", ""D'Yer Mak'er"", ""Fool in the Rain"", or ""In the Evening"").

This repackaging of the cumbersome multibox set issued previously has been very well done.

The sound is incredibly good throughout considering the hatchet jobs Columbia Records (now Sony) used to bestow on some of their artists in the 1960s.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"If you love Stravinsky or the Copland/Bartok/Shostakovich/etc variant of 20th century music, you must buy this for the sheer price performance.  If not, buy it anyway and listen to the pieces in chronological order, progressing to the next piece only when the current piece makes sense to your ear.  (Skip the [very early] Symphony in E-flat, and be prepared for a few clunkers.)  Be ravished.",65,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"I really consider this the best deal I have ever gotten on Amazon; I purchased this NEW for around $30.  This set includes a majority of Stravinsky's works, and definitely provides the most important ones.  More importantly, all of these recordings are conducted by  STRAVINSKY himself, which is most definitely a huge plus.  The audio quality is great, and of course nothing can be said about the interpretation since they're his own.  The price for this many works is astounding, and I highly recommend this to any classical enthusiast.",89,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"It's been a very long time since I've waiting for Stravinsky's ballets by Stravinsky, even though I have some very good performances by Boulez, Bernstein and Abbado...but nothing like original author's direction, the scent of his work beyond formalisms of the score. And finally, I made it...and even more! Having a complete box containing the works of Stravinsky BY Stravinsky is a real treasure, by all means.

This box set is quite complete, excellent sound and very cheap. Only two observations: one, operas and melodramas need lyrics and, two, it would be much better considering some works in its original language, like Les Noces.

Anyway, excelent job and very convenient...give it a try!",113,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"Yes, I have strong sympathy for all the reviews which have given five stars rate to this box set hereinbefore. I bought the same music in mid-line 22 CD luxury box incarnation under the title 'IGOR STRAVINSKY THE RECORDED LEGACY' last year. Sure the bargain box set edition here offers even more value economically and will benefit more music lovers in the world.

You can say nothing except listening to breathlessly when Igor Stravinsky, as both the composer and the exponent, conducts the performances of almost all his own music, to say nothing of the consistently excellent sound quality, which is especially important to the music of Stravinsky. Many thanks to Sony/CBS production team who made not only excellent original recordings but also marvellous CD transfers. A great achievement indeed!

I would also like to recommend everyone Stravinsky's small but meaningful book 'Poetics of Music'. It tells you what his attitudes to music are, illuminates further your experience of listening to his music and lets you know why so much influence he has long had on other composers of the world.

Let's go back to Stravinsky's music and enjoy it...",190,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,This box set is absolutely wonderful! I enjoy listening to Stravinsky conducting his own works - it's the ultimate interpretation. I have no complaints.,24,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"When Columbia (CBS) decided to record all the works of Stravinsky conducted by the composer, it became one of the most spoken about ventures during the 60s and 70s. I remember the vinyl box set and how I wished I had the extra money to acquire this set. Now Sony has remastered the sessions on CD. These are awesome performances of some of the greatest music written in the 20th Century.",71,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"...but why couldn't they re-master them?  Having just watched Jewels  by the Paris Opera Ballet on DVD, I was curious about his Capriccio for Piano, which was the first from this set  I played.  This was the music to Rubies, the second of the 'Jewels' which was hilarious, exciting, touching, and what else can I say?  Very sexy.  I was not disappointed. If you're a Stravinsky-ite, this set is a must.  Highly recommended.",73,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000PTYUQG,"Previously a full set of all of Stravinsky's work was well over $200 and since that version is out of print, it sells for far more now.  Where can you get 22 CDs of music for around $30?  I am thrilled with this set, although there is just one small booklet with very little material in it.  A nice plus is that each CD jacket does have the selections listed on the back.  It's a cheapo cardboard box and the CDs are in paper sleeves, but what can one expect for around $30?  If you have always wanted a full set of all Stravinsky's work without paying through the nose for it, this is the set for you.  This set doesn't always contain the best interpretations of Stravinky's work, but most Stravinsky ""fans"" will buy copies of their favorites as well as owning this complete set.  Includes some Stravinsky rehearsals too, as well as a clip of Stravinsky talking about the Rite of Spring.  Includes some suites as well as the full work.",173,12

Heading into work she finds out there has a been a change of plans to schedule and she will be paired with The Ripper. The strange name draws her in and gives her worry. Their first night on stage is explosive to say the least.

Cole, The Ripper has a darker secret that you have to read and follow to find out. Every moment is played out and eventually all demons come out of the closet.

This is everything that happened in Choosing You, but from Garret's point of view.  If you've read the first book, then you already know he's pretty freaking awesome.  Getting to see the story told from his perspective really just helped me love him more than I already did.

The biggest issue is that there is a lot of repetitious story line.  Sometimes it felt like she just copied and pasted paragraphs from Jade's point of view but changed the name to Garret.  Although there are some new scenes, and those were definitely worth the read.

A routine check alerts the crew to the presence of an object that will nearly intersect their path.  The Captain is compelled to make a decision to investigate or fly by.  The piece was well written and interesting enough to grab my attention. I will continue reading the series.",111,0
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"This is rather medium size story (72 pages) than real book, and it is just prelude to full-size book - ""The Pericles Conspiracy"".

Reading the story was quite refreshing experience.
Nnowadays in s-f books there is usually sub-space, FTL, black hole passages etc. which (for me) is just easy bypass for interesting problems.
It is much more ambitious and harder to write interesting book where action is limited by laws of physics presently known to us. That way it is much harder to create interesting universe, fulfilled with interesting action. There is just no way to make chases through galaxy etc. Action has to be much more developed to be interesting.

And ""Passing in the Night"" satisfies those conditions. Mankind is limited to slower than light travels, 500 years colonization means only few colonized planets no further than 20 light years from earth, each passage makes years, not days. Still the action set in those conditions is quite believable.

This story is good enough for me to read ""The Pericles Conspiracy"" in future.

The lack of fifth star is because I think that described meeting with aliens was not quite believable - especially that they left eggs and committed suicide...",200,1

They ( the middle crew) of Pericles had a moral obligation to help the stranded vessel  as well as a written directive on  handling of first contact with an alien culture. They simply had no idea how Earth would deal with the request, the task the aliens had charged the captain and crew with.
Well written and edited prequel to Pericles Conspiracy, only about 70 pages long. Please be advised that this is the start of a story not the story itself.

Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"I enjoyed this book despite the inconsistencies.
A spaceship on a routine flight encounters an alien ship in distress. The captain and crew attempt a rescue, (after consulting a manual) and contact is made.
What happens next is fairly predictable.
One thing that annoyed me was the over-simplified and misleading explanations for scientific concepts, such as traveling at light speed and aging.
Also, at one point in the book the author uses the words 'ring tone' and calls that an 'ancient' term, and then refers to the 'NSA' as a current organization. You can't have it both ways.

Results: Ok. Free. Don't think too hard.",105,4
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"I found this to be an intriguing introduction to what could be a very promising series.  The author develops the characters enough ( even in a short prequel) to make them both likable and have definite histories that are alluded to and hopefully explained further.  The math and physics were well thought out, and totally acceptable for the sci-fi genre it is, so no red flags there. Some actions could have used a bit more back story to give them context and set them up, but it WAS a short introduction so no faults there and maybe the back story will come later.  All in all I will DEFINITELY  read the next installment The Pericles Conspiracy.",116,5
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"This story is very short and it is well written.  If I could afford it, I would buy Michael Kingswood's next book, ""The Pericles Conspiracy"" and continue enjoying the story.  Perhaps another time.",33,6
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"Fun little short story of interstellar colony ships which literally ""pass in the night.""  The writing was a little stilted in places but I enjoyed it.",26,7
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"This story of first contact was a good, quick read that leads very nicely into the authors follow-up work, The Pericles Conspiracy.

I am always interested to see how authors deal with space travel and light speed. Do they go the Star Trek route and say that time remains the same on the ship as it does outside the ship or does time slow down on the ship. Kingswood opts for staying consistent with physics and saying that time slows down as an object approaches the speed of light. It makes for interesting reading and characters who are much older than they look.

Passing in the night did its job and made me want to read the next book. A great read.",122,8
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,It's a good start leading up to a new series. For a short free prequel it's a introduction.  It leaves you wanting to know about the story and where it leads. It does what it's supposed to do.,38,9
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,I really enjoyed the story. It definitely ended too quickly.,10,10
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"I enjoyed reading this prequel and found it to be interesting and well-written. What happens when future humans finally encounter intelligent life off-planet? You'll have to read to find out. In fact, I look forward to more from this author. This is more like a novella or a long story and it perfectly sets up the next installment.",58,11
Kindle_Store,B005G826KI,"I don't usually write reviews, but this book was interesting to me for several reasons. The premise is relatively unique and treated in a unique way.  Good character development and lacking most of those annoying spelling and grammar errors found in most books of this genre. The science is pretty well grounded and well explained. I liked it, and was encouraged enough to buy the expensive follow-on ""The Pericles Conspiracy.  You'll have to read my review of that book - no spoilers for you. Go ahead and download it, after all, it's free, but be prepared to shell out for the next installment.",103,12

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003AND1IC,"I really love this cd.  She did a wonderful job setting it up!  I like that she put all the slow songs together and the more upbeat songs together.  That way, if you're not in the mood for the slow stuff, you can skip to track seven and listen to the second half of the cd.  It's great!",58,2

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003AND1IC,"Laura Bell Bundy's ""Achin' and Shakin'"" is a very solid debut album.  It includes 6 songs for the achin' side and 6 songs for the shakin' side.  She sounds great on this cd and should have a long career in country music.",42,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003AND1IC,"I rarely write music reviews but I had to after buying this train wreck of an album. I really like her first release Giddy On Up (when I can listen to it without picturing the horrific video she made for it). But this album is seriously bad. The lyrics lack substance and the music lacks depth. I had high expectations for this album but there are only two good tracks: Giddy On Up and Boyfriend which isn't country at all. I don't consider myself to be that critical when it comes to music, and of course music is subjective, but I was very disappointed. My advice is to save your money. This was $5.99 when I bought it and even at that price I think it was a waste of money. Sorry to any Laura Bell Bundy fans.",138,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,I've been listening to more and more comedy.  I think Patton Oswalt is brilliant.  His style is very rapid fire and high energy.  His delivery is a cool juxtaposition of energy of delivery and cynical humor.  I really enjoy his work.,41,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Oswalt, like David Cross, releases a lot of similar cds; has a strong fanbase, but many will not care for him in a cd-sized dose.  I find his material repetitive. For whatever, reason, I find some other comics who have a lot of complaints to register--Bill Burr, Tommy Johnagin, etc--funnier and more varied in their content.",56,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,Patton's humor may not be for everyone but I really like this guy.  Extremely creative humor that just gets me cracking up time after time.  Patton is an extremely creative storyteller and is a wonderful entertainer.,36,3

Compared to his previous albums, this is much more focused on the daily minutia of life, and less so on any political/nerdy subjects that were covered more in-depth on his previous albums.  The changes of his life (i.e. his fatherhood) have really come through on his comedy, and honestly, he is still just as funny as he ever has been.  I listened to this album with a number of my closest friends, and there were quite literally times where we were having problems breathing we were laughing so hard.  ""The Ham Incident"" is hands down one of the funniest things I've heard in a long time.

Fans of Patton Oswalt should not give this one a second thought and buy it, but those of you on the fence will find this album to be one of Patton's most approachable (and funniest) yet.",181,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Note: I am a huge fan of Mr. Oswalt's standup comedy. I do not know him nor am I a friend of his trying to help promote sales.

This album is very funny, it does not disappoint. Patton Oswalt is at the peak of his game here. His wordplay, imagery and insights are top notch as always. ""Finest Hour"" had me laughing so uncontrollably at times I was beginning to worry about my present mental condition.

I hope that if you do buy this album that you would enjoy it as much as I do.",95,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Always great for ""outside the box of boxes"" thinking!  What I like best is that Patton understands his own oddities and doesn't back down from them!  Embraces the overweight Star Wars nerd that lurks inside each of us - or doesn't!",41,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Basically in short (how I like reviews to be) The beginning of the album is great, middle not so much, rest of middle to the ending AMAZING!!! I cried of laughter for the Ham Incident and the Horror of New York City. Not the best Patton album but very good. Can't wait for the next one!",56,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"I am coming from the angle of a King of Queens fan point of view.  And I always knew Patton was a stand up comedian, but I never really checked him out.  Thankfully I did, this is actually funny.  I have gone on to get a few more of his albums, and this is the one I listen to the most.  Very funny.",63,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,This album is great.  Very happy with the mp3 version.  Quick and easy to my computer.  Easy to transfer to the car.,22,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"I've only seen the Comedy Central edited/censored version of this and never the whole thing. Everytime I listen to one of his albums I end up in tears of laughter and I have to cover my mouth and hold back sounds so those in my house aren't wondering why I'm cackling out loud for no reason they can tell.

If you are a Patton Oswalt fan you will not be disappointed in this album.",74,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Patton Oswalt is is hugely funny, geeky and thought-provoking.  You'll want to hang out with this guy after listening.  Awesome!",20,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Simply put, Patton Oswalt is the best stand up comedian working today, and this set is clever and painfully hilarious. Perhaps not actually his finest hour (I'd give that to WEREWOLVES AND LOLLIPOPS), but close enough to be more than worth your time.",43,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Glad I bought it.

Patton Oswalt is my favorite working comedian.  I was a bit disappointed in his last CD, ""My Weakness is Strong,"" which I didn't believe up to the level of ""Werewolves and Lollipops,"" but I think this one is a bit stronger.  He shows no signs of slowing down.  What I like the most about him, other than his voices, is that his moral compass comes showing through his jokes, whether he means it to or not.  By this point, simply hearing that Patton Oswalt has come out with a new CD is enough to get me to click over and buy it without asking too many questions.",111,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B005DLBLP4,"Patton really takes his stand-up to another level with this special. The layering of material and his ever-broadening subject matter almost insure that you'll need to hear the whole thing a second time just to soak in all subtle references and jokes he throws out. My only complaint, which is not really the fault of the album or Patton, is that this CD doesn't double as a DVD. There are some bits to this CD that I'm certain would be even funnier in watching them performed and really, I just want to go see a Patton Oswalt stand-up show.
All around this is a fantastic stand-up well worth the money and several listen - throughs.",115,14

First heard of them on a 45 from many years ago and thought they were a one record wonder.  Thanks to Google and Amazon I was glad to be found wrong (again) and purchased this and a different cd.

""It's So Hard"" is different from his  other stuff,  and when he says ""I just lost 100 pounds, I'm tryna  live!"" you can't help but become sad.  Although Captial Punishment was  much better than this, this is still a good buy, if you like Pun.",90,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004SCCO,U know all you cats who write reviews on here don't know anything...most of you are young kids who wouldnt know a good hip hop album if 2pac and biggie came from the dead and wrote it themselves..this album by Pun one of the best albums ever made...u can listen to the whole album without skipping...his lyrics are creative...he is one of the best mc's to come around in a long time...before you young cats write reviews know what makes up a good album and whats good...i saw one cat wrote that they were chingy's number one fan...hahahahaha..what a joke...Pun had more talent in one of his loogies than chingy will ever have...learn what talent is little kids,118,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004SCCO,"Big Pun is one of the best lyricists of all time and that he shows in many of the songs that appear on this album, however there are a few weak songs which makes moment of it a drag these are: ""You Was Wrong"", ""My Turn"", ""Wrong Ones"" and ""Ms. Martin"" which isn't even Big Pun's song, it is Remy Martin who does the rapping and Pun is only featured in the chorus.
But there however is more great than wack songs and the best ones includes the Puerto-Rican-Pride-song ""100%"", the very funny: ""N***a S**t"", and the slamming songs: ""Off Wit His Head"",""We Don't Care"" and the hit-singel ""It's so hard"" featuring Donell Jones on guest-vocals.
U probably won't be dissapointed if u buy this but keep the remote controll in your hands for when the wack songs starts playing.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004SCCO,Big Pun was a Cool Brother but his Work was Often Lacking.the Music&Lyrics here just are Typical Industry Fair. We Don't Care is a Tight cut as is My Turn.but on a Whole it's nothing worth Getting.it's Sad  cuz He had some Talent.but this isn't the way it should have Ended.,51,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00004SCCO,"Pun had skills, no doubt. His 1998 debut ""Capital Punishment,"" was a classic. This album does not measure up to that, but it's still pretty good overall.
 ""Watch Those"" is a nice track in which  Pun spits those same kinds of wicked lines he mastered on Capital  Punishment. ""It's So Hard"" finds Pun experimenting with a  different flow, in which he hightens his voice during the middle and end of  each line. It's also rather sad, as he says at the end of the first verse  ""I just lost a hundred pounds, I'm tryna live!""
 ""New  York Giants"" is a hyped up joint, which isn't surprising considering  it features everybody's favorite hyped-up duo, M.O.P. ""N*gga  Sh*t"" features a dope beat courtesy of Buckwild, but it's far too  short, clocking in at only 1:45. Other standout tracks include ""Off  Wit His Head,"" ""Leather Face,"" and ""Laughing At  You.""
 The album trails off slightly at the end, with a few tracks  (and guests) that fail to justify their being on the album.  Overall,  despite it's flaws and short length, ""Yeeeah Baby"" is still a  worthy buy.

Although this doesn't touch Capital Punishment, it is still better than most other CD's. You can lsiten to every track without skipping, and his rhymes are still tight on this. My favourite cuts are:

Off With His Head, It's so hard, We Don't Care, 100%, Wrong Ones, My Turn.

Definately an album to pick up, as well as Capital Punishment. Unless you're into wack commercial pop music, then stick to your Chingy's.

This Cd is better than his first. Many  great guest appearances. M.O.P is great on the song NY Giants.  ""Laughing at You"" is hysterical, with the lyrics aimed at his  school day torments. ""It's so Hard"" is a great song and a great  first single. This CD will be appreciated by any rap fan. RIP Pun",95,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000B66PDO,"The main thing that strikes me about Cat Stevens (or Yusuf Islam as he calls himself now) is that, during his Cat Stevens phase from 1966 to 1978, he made really, really *nice* music. The melodies, the words, and of course, the man's distinctive voice and guitar-picking....just really good, spiritual, uplifting songs. He is an incredibly talented troubadour, and this 2-CD set,""Gold,"" collects a healthy dose of classic Cat Stevens music. Although, as other reviewers have pointed out, ""Gold"" is a bit incomplete, most of the big hit songs are here, such as ""Matthew And Son,"" ""Morning Has Broken,"" ""Wild World,"" ""Moonshadow,"" etc., but ""Gold"" also features tracks from Stevens' later albums that aren't as well known. These songs are just as wonderful as the hits, including ""Angelsea,"" ""Last Love Song,"" and the very impressive, 18-minute ""Foreigner Suite."" And, for the grand finale, ""Gold"" features the brand-new song, ""Indian Ocean,"" which Stevens/Islam recorded for charity. It is a *beautiful* song, and worth the price of admission alone. There are several Cat Stevens compilations already on the market, but ""Gold"" is an excellent one, and a great introduction to the magical music of Cat Stevens.",194,3

She was sooo wrong on so many different levels and all of that was not about her alcohol problem.  John is confused and his heart has been damaged soo much by Amy.

Sophia and Cara stole my heart.  I felt their love and Sophia's pain and fear.  Sophia had so much inner strength to endure what she went through and still be able to love and trust.

I love how Jason and Kay were there for John, Amy and Sophia.  They used their own situation to help their friends navigate a touchy and dangerous road.

Sometime we are with the wrong person for the right reasons. The heart is the absolute truth when it comes to unconditional love and friendship. Sophia and John were meant to be together. I don't agree with how it started but totally understand the conflicting emotions they had. What Amy did was so hurtful and selfish. She really didn't get it.
I highly recommend this story. Beware that there is adultery and abortion involved. These things I'm totally against but still enjoyed the story.",107,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"I was surprised how good this release was. Fogerty touches on several styles here, including the bouncy 70's-style blues-rocker ""Headlines"" ala Bad Company. The pumping bassline is infectious. ""Knockin' On Your Door"" is pure 60's-style soul, spiced up by a punchy horn section. ""Change in the Weather"" is a sultry blues-rocker with a funky groove. (Another version of this tune can be found on Buddy Guy's FEELS LIKE RAIN cd, where he teams up with country-rocker Travis Tritt.)
Things start to slip a bit with ""Violence is Golden"", a scathing anti-war track. Although it has a biting chorus, the rest is oddly mellow & awkward. ""Wasn't That a Woman"" is just as trite as it sounds. Even worse is ""Soda Pop"", a complete waste of 5:53. ""Sail Away"" is a so-so finale.
Some may be put off by the opening instrumental, ""Goin' Back Home"". The track opens with a choir-like keyboard intro, followed by a slow, bluesy guitar toward the end. Personally, I like it.",165,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"John Fogerty's 3rd solo album ""Eye Of The Zombie"" #73, is a much rockier effort than his comeback album in 1985's ""Centerfield"".  John says he doesn't really care much for this release anymore, but I still find it a very good rock'n roll release.  It produced a hit single with the title track, going to #81 on the hot 100 and #3 on the mainstream  rock chart, it also scored with ""Change In The Weather"" #3 mainstream rock and ""Headlines"" #27 mainstream rock, other favorites include ""Sail Away"", as close to a CCR tune as you can get, ""Violence Is Golden"", some sharp guitar on this one and the funk of ""Wasn't That A Woman"".  ""Soda Pop"", might be the only weak tune here, but I can tolerate it.  Great lost album by Mr. John Fogerty.  Due to John's drinking at the time, he doesn't care much for this album.",150,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"This album is worth owning, since appearently physically buying the cd is the only way to acquire it(rather than by download, that i could find), i'm sure due to the legendary squabbling over the Creedence rights. Still it's worth the bother. recommend ""Change in the Weather"" for the 'groove' and the whole album for the songwriting... good, not great, but a must have for any serious Creedence or Fogerty fan. on the whole i rank it better than ""Centerfield"", personally.",80,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,I bought it on vinyl when it first came out and have played it for years until my needle on my player came out. I gotta get it on CD!,30,4

I liked this better when this first came out, despite it's somewhat  bitter tone. But it doesn't age very well for me. He tried to go for the  ""modern"" sound at the time, which meant using drum machines and  synthesizers. So it sounds very dated to me. There are good songs on here  though; ""Change in the Weather"", ""Sail Away"" and  ""Headlines"" hold up.",97,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,loved this cd when i first heard it in '86. sounds awesome. used in a greatest hits cd i made for my dad. he loves it.,26,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"There was some good, very different stuff for Fogerty on this album, but also too many pretty bad songs. The title song ""Eye of the Zombie"" was just awful. While ""Going Back Home,"" and ""Change in the Weather"" were quite good, and ""Knockin' on Your Door"" and especially ""Wasn't That a Woman"" were fun steps into old time soul music. The other's were, IMO examples of some of the tuneless and lyrically uninteresting songs he was putting out during this period.",81,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"This is an album that was heavily criticized on its day. It tries to distance from the CCR sound and to get a ""modern sound"" in tune with the 80's. Even JCF himself doesn't play songs from this album live. But I think is a good album, Eye of the Zombie is a killer song, Change in the Weather, Headlines are cool songs too. Soda Pop tries to be a ""dance"" song with a funky sound, if you like funk like me this could be refreshing. This version I bought is actually a High Definition CD, and the sound obviously is remarkable. A misunderstood album and of course Centerfield is much better than this. But I think this one has a grain of its own. Enjoy",126,12

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002L9V,"I bought this disc primarily for one song, ""Change In The Weather"". It was worth it. Unlike his Blue Moon Swamp album, where he skips the political and environmental crap in favor of extremely well written and performed songs, Eye Of The Zombie sounds angry and lacks the Fogerty magic on most of the songs. The title track is a good song, but ""Change In The Weather"" may well be one John's best songs, with plenty of the old Creedence Clearwater Revival sound and feel, and an extended jam reminiscent of CCR's version of ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"". Why this track has never been included in a greatest hits package borders on the criminal. The remastered version of Eye Of The Zombie has sound that is superior to the original CD release and if you like spooky, swampy music, you may well enjoy it.",146,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"I love Western movie theme's and this CD has some of the best that were ever made,I also like that Amazon has these items for sale.",26,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"I've only listened to 1 song from this CD, so feel free to mark this review negatively.  But the other ""one-star"" review here on Amazon should be heeded -- these are re-recordings.  The song I listened to (on Pandora) is entitled ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and is based on tunes from that soundtrack.  But the actual first half is from the piece ""As a Judgment"" and the second half is based on the film's overture.  Both halves are re-done, and while not horrible, have lost a lot of power.  The original As a Judgment, in particular, is a masterpiece so buy the original soundtrack!  If you don't know these songs, you may be safe buying this CD because you won't be disappointed by the comparison.  Still, I wonder how badly the other tunes have been mangled when re-recorded?  I wouldn't take the risk of buying this CD unless I'd heard it entirely (not just Amazon samples).",159,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"I enjoy listening to these, and recapturing nostalgic feelings of the mythical Old West. A real variety. Especially like The Magnificent Seven and True Grit.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"This album is great, but here's what you need to know about it:

-All of the music is performed by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.  It's not from any of the original sources.  So the Bonanza theme song is not exactly the same as what you hear in the TV show opening.  And the guy singing the song from High Noon is good, but it's not the same guy who sings the song in the movie.  Just be aware that this is a compilation of the music, but not from the original sources.

-Some great Western songs are missing.  For example, they have a great medley of the music from ""The Searchers"", one of the greatest Westerns ever made, and the medley really makes any fan of the movie appreciate how well done the score was, but it does NOT include the actual theme song from ""The Searchers"" (What Makes a Man to Wander?).

-It includes some themes that could just as well have been left off.  I know, that's my personal opinion, but not every track on this set is a winner.

So long as you know that, it's a fun album.",192,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"I actually got this for my dad as a present since he LOVES western movies. But I actually really like it too. I started listening to the music everyday after I got it because I liked it so much, and so does my dad. So bottom line, if you like western movies you will like this CD.",57,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"Received this set as a Christmas present and am thoroughly enjoying it. The collection is made up of new arrangements not performed by the original artists but for the most part the arrangements are fairly faithful to the source material. There are a couple of real gems in the mix. The tracks are alphabetically sorted by film title which is kind of helpful. The one downside is that the solo vocalist used on the tracks that require one (Gunfight at OK Corral for instance) sounds like he is delivering an operatic performance, which doesn't work all that well to my ears. He has a great voice, but it's just the wrong type of delivery.",114,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CQO19S,"This 4 disc rendition of 100 western movie soundtrack themes is OK.  My fault in final analysis because I was looking for ORIGINAL SOUND TRACKS and although the renditions done are pretty good, hearing another singer do OK Corral or High Noon other than Frankie Lane or Tex Ritter is just not getting the job done.  The instrumental cuts although not original are still good.  Another disc is coming in mid March which states it is ""all original"" and I will check that one out.  Last, some of the cuts selected are not distinct in terms of deserving a notice as a western theme to be included. With 100 cuts you are going to get some added as ""filler content"" and for me that is what happened.  Last and Last, it notes that Dimitri Tiomkin is the ""composer"" but it is the Prague Orchestra who does the arrangements and plays the music....again, not original.",154,9

Kindle_Store,B00HQLF9N4,"I was happy to see this book come out. I've been waiting to see what Ace and the crew would get into. Ok...maybe because I'm not use to this type of storyline a few things had me smh. For starters I don't really know why this is in the romance category. Maybe that's the norm, but there were like three love scenes in this book. Then the story itself was so full of crazy and unnecessary drama that the explanations at the end just fell flat. It could have been less drama with a more believable ending and it still would have been good. I was happy with the end but I just feel like it was too late to make up for the very busy body of the story. Lastly, the editing once again was horrible. It really does take away from the flow of the story, and when you're already semi disappointed in what you're reading it sucks even more. Well I still love Amir, Jay and the boys and I'm glad Jay had a bigger part this time but I'm not so trilled with the story itself. So 3 1/2 maybe 4 stars for this final installment.",200,5

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"This cd, which is at least the 3rd collection of theirs, is really pretty good, but roughly the same as the others. I remember when I first got this, I expected more of an ""Enya"" sound, since she does have family in ""Clannad"". But this actually is not so much new age, as it is some traditional and pop. Alot sounds more like ""The Corrs"" or ""Secret Garden"", than it does ""Enya"". Still very good of course. Smooth, mellow, and mostly relaxing. One thing I don't understand is why my favorite song ""I Will Find You"" (Theme from Last of the Mohicans) isn't on here, or any other collection. That is only on ""Banba"", as far as I know. Overall this is a very nice listen, just fairly interchangable with everything else they've done.",134,0

I then bought few more of Clannad's, but nothing matched this one. This is a unique album that was made with passion. As a whole, it is very romantic. There is something enigmatic about a song with lyrics I don't understand, yet the music tells it all. Those tracks with English words are simply beautiful, almost poetic. I've worn out my CD copy like the other reviewer, and am in need to buy a new one.",105,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00003OP2L,"Yes, there are seven cuts in common between this album and Rogha, and yet each CD does have its own sound.  This makes this an excellant introduction to the group, Clannad, as also is Rogha.  The difference, as has been mentioned in another review, is that this compilation presents the groups absolute essential cuts along with great cuts that emphasize the newer new age facet of their work, while if you're looking for stronger celtic flavor, you would prefer the other one.  Those that are, IMHO, the strongest new age and best are ""Scarlet Inside"", ""The Wild Cry"" (really great instrumentation here), ""Turning Tide"" (bird like warbling and strong dramatic sense), and the concluding number, ""Many Roads"".",117,3

Magazine_Subscriptions,B00007B1C3,"Sail Magazine is a ten-minute read then toss it.  I cancelled it after a year.

Look, my opinion is just my opinion.  Almost all magazines today are almost all advertising; either overt ads, or covert advertising disguised as articles and reviews about new products.  I spent ten minutes every issue reading a few columns written by famous names such as Nigel Calder et. al and that was it.  I've read their books for the most part anyway, so these few useful parts were not worth the $10 a year subscription fee, so I cancelled it.

Your mileage may vary.

But advertising can be informative if read with discrimination, especially if you are new to the sport and want to get an overview of what's going on commercially.  I am old enough to remember when the America's Cup was a contest between boats and sailors, not between computers and lawyers, so my viewport may be very different from yours.  Fair winds.",160,2

I really like that the characters are ""every day"" people facing issues that you can relate to while not feeling like you are weighed down with real life problems. The ""romance"" is always at the forefront of this story.

The chemistry between the primary characters sizzles.  I love that the hero is Jamaican; strong alpha male.  Sabrina is the perfect heroine and a good balance to Jamison.  She is a fighter and as a reader you are happy for her success and what she had to endure to find happiness.

This book is well written and very well edited.  While reading this story it is clear this author is a student of the written word.  The story development is carefully planned and laid the groundwork for the future stories focusing on Sabrina's sisters.

The mind and heart are some seriously powerful weapons and in this book they are book used as positive and negative forces... a broken heart can be something to stump you or press you on, but when you have 2 hearts and they are both broken...watch out.
Two people who are supposed to be enemies find each other over time and space and build a connection through their minds... one fights for the other and the other is more focused on their missions, and in the end they each deal with the pain of loss in their own ways.

The characters in the story are unique, they all have their own personalities and reactions to every situation. They all blend together well, and help make the story believable and interesting, as well as keeping the reader guessing. The novel was very well written and it works very well to draw the reader in.

I really enjoyed reading this sci-fi novel even though I am not really in sci-fi. First of all, the book cover attracted me. As always being said by people, a picture tells a thousand words. This book is no exception.

True enough, as I flipped from the first page to the last page, I was captivated the way the author illustrated the characters. It was so engaging. I really like plot which is full of surprises, thrilling moments that at times caught me off guard. The character, Kala is well-developed with a sense of purpose. I was amazed how she tries to push for her peace-keeping efforts despite the was is in progress.

Without giving too much away, as I read chapter 3, I noticed that Kala was in a solemn state of mind whereby she was about to meet her master. There is something Kala will face on here onwards. You have to read it to find out more.

And the story was simply incomplete.  There wasn't a cliffhanger, it just ended.  It was like a class assignment that had to reach a certain number of pages.  Rather than finish the scene, the author just stopped.

And there should have been much more description of the alien races and cultures.  Are Xenon and Dentonian the same species?  They both have two hearts so....  What started the war?  What do they look like?  What about the other races?  How did the cybernetics start?  Some background and narrative is necessary.

The two heavy hitters among the the Smog's lineup are Wilco's Jeff Tweedy and The Jayhawks' Gary Louris, and it is to them that many of the best moments on the album can be attributed.
Tweedy's contributions include the very Wilco-like ""Lost Love"" and ""I Can't Keep From Talking,"" as well as the traditional folk number ""Please Tell My Brother,"" that is one of the best things he's ever written.  For his part, Louris answers with the very Jayhawks-esque ""Until You Came Along"" and ""Jane"" as well as the surprisingly rocking closing track ""Jennifer Save Me,"" that is the CD's best song.

When Farrar  answers with ""Wide Swing Tremolo"", Here comes this..this...Man!  What a great, care free jaunt! These are not throwaways.  (""Mainstream"" was, though) I can't believe that as a fan of rock  and country I am so priviledged to keep getting such great music by so many  bands and side projects and things which continue to be top-notch in  quality, creativity and emotion.

I also like the variety  of lineups they used in recording, all in all one kick butt album.",72,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000DCWE,"I suppose I am a bit of an old fart, but I haven't liked a CD this much in a long, long time.  It reminds me of the way I felt about REM in their early days.  It's reminiscent of songs like ""Don't go back to Rockville"" and most of REM's DeadLetter Office, but then again, I don't remember even liking the old REM as much as this.  I'll say this too, there are no songs you want to skip.  All 15 tracks are quality, just put it in and let it go.  God I hope these guys stay together and continue to put it out this well.",108,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000DCWE,"Just recently picked this one up sight unseen, and am very pleased. A traditional yet fresh sound, with simple but solid songwriting. Sounds like Mick Taylor-era Stones crossed with the Smithereenes, infused with perhaps  a small dose of Cracker. It also in spots reminds me of the early 70's Hugh  Nicholson band Blue. And the packaging art paying homage to one of the  greatest fiction mags in American history is designed to catch the  discerning eye. Very likeable effort that shows a lot of promise for  development.",87,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000DCWE,"A great CD cover lives up to the coolness...
I don't even know what year I bought this CD, it's like I've had it forever. I can't even remember the motivation behind the purchase.
Suffice to know that if you enjoy the ""Americana"" music style, or pop with hints of country and blues and rock... Really it's everything beautifully concocted in a tonic so delicious you won't care what to call it.
This is such a marvelous CD I will simply say, if you're here reading this review and poking about wondering ""what to buy"" this is a guaranteed winner. It's probably better than the derivatives (bands) that created it. It includes a few different vocal styles (each wonderful) and a few song style approaches that vary (modestly) and are exquisite in execution.
Wow that's a wordy little explanation but it moves me and I hope you'll give it a try too. This is a worthy CD and a beautiful addition to any varied collection of Americana music.",168,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"this band is not tool, they won't ever be. Its a good cd, but its kind of stereotypical for everyone to label them as being tool rip offs...the fact of the matter is, the lyrics are not as deep as maynards, nor will they ever be.
The musical talent is there, but its different than adam, danny, and justin. Look at the drummer for earshot, not even in the same league with danny carey, nor has he been trained as extensively. that should tell it right there.....",87,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"Any band that trys to sound like Tool in an industry of Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, and Kid Rock, is ok with me.  I found this cd for 8 dollars.  I was definatly willing to pay 8 dollars for a cd that could potentially be of some quality.  After listening to it I think it is only worth 6 dollars.  To be blunt the guitar is not as good as Tool, the drums are not as good as Tool, Vocals are better than Limp Bizkit but not as good as Tool. I think ""A perfect Circle"" is coming out with some news stuff eventually.  Save your money for that.",109,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"Earshot has a great single in ""Get Away"" but another than that song, the album just falls short.  It was very disappointing to hear, especially when the single gave the band so much promise.  I will admit the fact that his voice sounds like a fetal Maynard James Keenan (although lacking variety and power) is a very good feature about this band.  But other than that, they just don't have what it takes.  The rest of the album is very repetitive and mediocre at best.  Maybe this band has a future, maybe they don't.  The single shows promise, what they do after this will show everyone what kind of a band they really are.",114,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"This band is alright. Not really my type of music, but alright. I only bought the CD because I was told it sounded very similar to Tool. I tried REALLY hard to hear the similarity, but found them to sound much more like Chavelle. I really don't see how people can say this sounds like Tool at all. They are different in just about every way possible. They are lacking as far as lyrical meaning. I wasn't impressed, whereas Tool's Lyrics seem to lick my soul. There are I believe 3 guitarists in this band, so even structurally they are far off from Tool.

For all who keep saying this band sounds like Tool, just stop... although I'm sure this band is flattered by it, they probably want their own identity. And to compare them to a band as musically evolved as Tool is just ignorant.",146,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"I read the reviews before I picked up this CD and found that everyone compared this band to Tool - well, I don't know why as what I heard was a band creating their own style. The only similarity to Tool is by having a singer who can actually sing, and more figured features to the songs - a ploy also tried by other good artists such as Linkin Park, amongst others. Earshot has succeeded where the others failed -the singer can actually sing! Songs like 'Get Away', 'Ordinary Girl' and 'This World' prove that there are actually some great singers getting out there, as well as the songs themselves being catchy (which Tool are not - well, not as much anyways) and well written, with hooks and changes in all the right places. Recommended to all those looking for talent in their music.",144,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"I kept hearing about how this band called Earshot was so much like TOOL, and since I'm a huge TOOL fan, I decided to pick it up. ""Letting Go"" is a pretty good album, and the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me. Why this group has gotten negative press for being ""TOOL wannabes"" baffles me, however. There are a couple of songs that sound very much like TOOL (""Get Away"", ""Wake Up"", and ""My Time""), but there are hints of other bands as well. Korn, for instance, and if you listen, there are some stark similarities to Linkin Park in these songs as well. In fact, I'd say that overall they are more like Linkin Park than TOOL. All bands are influenced by someone who came before them, so I don't see what the big deal is.
Anyway, the album is good. There's a lot of variety in the pace of the songs (similar to TOOL there). I gave it three stars, but it's really been growing on me, and I'd say it's 3+ stars at least. If you like music like Linkin Park, Korn, TOOL, Disturbed, etc., then I'd pick this one up too.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"I first heard Earshot on the Queen of The Damned Soundtrack, so I decided to pick up their album. Although some of the songs are repetive, I found most of them to be great and very listener-friendly. To be honest this album probably only deserves 3 stars, but I got hooked on Tool through Earshot. Tool is unbelieveable, and you can't compare any band with them. In fact, if I had heard Earshot for the first time today I would probably be just like all of u ""Hardcore"" Tool fans and rip on them and call them a joke. But because this album WAS fun to listen to, and because Earshot led me to the greatest band in the world, this CD deserves 4 stars. Pick it up if you haven't found a style of music that you love... U might be a future TOOL fan.  O, and to all you ""Hardcore"" Tool fans.... stopping ripping on Earshot. You may be discouraging people from discovering Tool.

Since I been a Tool fan since they came out, I was wondering what compact disc this was on. I called the radio station and was suprised that the song was from a band called Earshot. They sound aloy like Tool but in many way's they dont. The guitar riff's are so awesome, it blew my mind away. Every song on the compact disc is excellent. Buy this compact disc, yoy won't be disatisfied.",92,8

Aside from that they are a great sounding band, and one that you should look into buying if you haven't already. I think it sounds much better than their second album which sounds so much different than this that I thought they were two separate bands.",77,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"Finally the much awaited release of ""Letting Go"" proves to be one of the best new music releases of this year!  This album features strong riffs and powerful lyrics, a combination that undoubtedly will leave you feeling Earshot's energy and motivation.  Favorite tracks include-Unfortunate, Ordinary Girl,and Not Afraid, though every song has it's unique style and mood elements.  ""Letting Go"" is a rock album that presents itself with powerful vocals and lyrics to accompany the already mesmerizing flow of the guitars and percussion.  This is one rock album you can listen to and appreciate the minute you put it in your cd player!",103,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"But still entertaining as can be. I like this album a lot, but it is not what I thought it was going to be when I bought it. The excellent track ""Get Away"" is the closest to Tool that they get, which disappointed me (Tool being the best band in existence), but I like that they have their own style and sound. This album is relatively short, which is also another dissapointment. Other than that I say give this a shot. Their sound is strong, and the singer's voice can be powerful (sort of like Maynard from aforementioned musical Gods Tool) and also fragile, which is a good quality. Go ahead and purchase this relatively cheap and valuable cd.",119,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000065DVB,"When I first reviewed this album two years ago, I gave it a glowing reviews. Unfortunately, the album doesn't have too much lasting value. They initially impressed me due to the vocalist's similarity to Maynard James Keenan, but the novelty of that wore thin quickly. The band doesn't have too much aside from that to back them up, leaving a rather average nu-metal band. If they worked at developing a more unique sound, there's definite potential for greatness. But as of this record, that potential is far from fulfilled.",89,13

Kindle_Store,B00IOBXHES,"I loved meeting and falling in love with the older, dominant Jack Stevens in Ditching the Dream.  In the second book in the series, we get to know more about the Jack growing up. We learn how he gets discovered by a modeling agency in his small town in Colorado and hightails it to New York with the little savings that he has and his truck to try to make it in the modeling industry. Isabelle takes us into how he finds his more dominant side and why he has become the ""confirmed bachelor"". And we finally get his thoughts and side of things on when he meets and falls in love with Beth.

It broke my heart at the end of Ditching the Dream when Beth left Jack to go back to her husband but we get to go on Jack's journey to try to win Beth back. You will really fall deeper in love with Jack Stevens in Not In My Wildest Dreams. I read this book in less than a day and could not put it down, even through an eight hour shift at work.

Kindle_Store,B00IOBXHES,"In this second book of the Dream Series, we see Jack back when he was 18 almost 19 years of age, when he was discovered by a woman from Ford Modeling Agency. We get a chance to see how he became a model, and the things he went through. We get to see what made him become a Dom, or should I say who and how. This is a really interesting flashback on Jack's life. It makes me wonder if all those small town Colorado people got him 150% wrong in their thinking about who and what he was when he lived with his family. How does Jack react when the woman he loves, for the first time ever, goes back to her husband in California? What does Jack do? What does Becca do when she shows up after being out of town for three days? Does he listen to his best friend and JSS Modeling partner and go after her? If he does go after her, what happens? We know she goes home to try to make it work with her husband. Does it?

Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"This prequel provides the background information to the relationships presented in ""Firelight"".  However, Callahan exhibits the same strong writing as she uses in her full length novels.

Centering on a strong male and a stronger female, ""Ember"" is almost poetic in its descriptions of Lord Archer struggling with his grotesque physical deformity, and of Miranda torturing herself with guilt.

With unusual characters, vivid descriptions, and a realistic plot -- except for the supernatural elements -- this could be a story of real life in Victorian London.  It is a tale of struggle, love and betrayal of the worst sort.",99,0

Kindle_Store,B006T2KUPI,"Ember, a prequel for Firelight, answers questions readers may have been wondering about.  For instance, readers learn why Miranda and Martin never married and what happened the night Miranda sealed her family's fate.

The back and forth between Miranda and Lord Archer was great because it was like seeing what each was doing at about the same time. I loved how both Miranda and Archer meant more to each other than they were willing to admit to themselves.

After reading Ember, I can see why Miranda and Archer's relationship was so explosive. Ember also helps explain some of the worries that the characters have in Firelight, like why Miranda's so reluctant to use her power.

I'm glad I waited until after reading Firelight to read Ember. I already knew who the characters were to each other and whenever the characters said something foreshadowing an event in Firelight, I knew just what they were talking about.

It ends with more questions than answers, but definitely sets up the main characters and leaves me wanting more. Miranda's ability is fascinating, and I look forward to seeing how she learns to utilize and manage it fully. I'm also intrigued to discover exactly what is Archer's curse/malady/disorder. The back and forth in the character pov's and the timeline was a bit confusing.  I wish the narrative was streamlined in a more linear way to provide better continuity. I did enjoy the foreshadowing in their dreams, and the idea that both characters dreamed of each other after only one meeting.

""Ember"" is characterized a prequel novella, but I'd consider it more like a companion piece highlighting a string of events leading to Archer & Miranda's reunion.

Most of those events are referenced in Firelight, which make them familiar, though enjoyable to read in more detail.  We get a closer look at Miranda's failed engagement and how she met Billy, as well as Archer's trip to Egypt and the Mexican vision quest that leads him back to London.

I don't know how well this will serve for people who haven't read the novel yet, but it works well for those of us who have.  It's simply missing the most vital part of what makes Firelight sing, which is the relationship between Archer and Miranda in action.  Still, it's a welcome extra for fans of the series.

I love the sound, but I just can't get past the fact that for some cameras angles, on most of the songs, the video has streaks/lines going thru the entire screen.  If these are lines that were the result of the method used to tape the show, fine. However, one would think if they transferred the original video to a digital copy, that they could tidy up the lines and remove most of them (or cover them up with color that matches the background?).

This concert very nearly did not happen, and it was only due to the tenacity of the fans in the audience and the overwhelming desire of the band to give them a great show despite horrible conditions that it was even made.  The raw energy and unique connection U2 have with their audience almost defies explanation.

This dvd captures them revving up the famous War Tour which put them on the map. If you don't have the War album, order it today! (I wish they would put out an honest, simple album like that again. Why do we have to wait years for overproduced mush like their last few albums?)

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"This is one of the most underrated albums of the past twenty years.  Tony Bennett covers most of Sinatra's best material from the 50's and 60's, and he doesn't try to musically photocopy Frank's phrasing or Nelson Riddle's superb orchestrations.  This is Tony being Tony, and that's more than enough.  Bennett ranks just behind Sinatra as the best pop vocalist of the past fifty years.  Bennett connects with every song, and it makes you wonder what they could have come up with if they did an album together.  Tony's version of ""One for My Baby"" is absolutely brilliant, and the way he interprets ""The Lady Is A Tramp"" must make Frank smile approvingly from his heavenly Hall of Fame.  If you're serious about Tony's musical body of work, ""Perfectly Frank"" has to be be one of your essential purchases.  It was released in 1992, and it is arguably one of top three or four albums of his career.  Buy it, listen to it, and treasure it.  This is great music as it's meant to be.",175,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"I am amazed at how few people realize this is one of the best recordings of the later 20th century.  This is Tony Bennett (in 1992) at what must be the absolute zenith of his talent.  Here is Tony with an extraordinarily honest, well selected, marvelously sung collection of songs -- a superb, deeply entertaining ""homage"" to the pack-leader, Frank Sinatra.  Let's face it -- THIS RECORDING IS VERY NEAR PERFECTION.  If you prize great vocals, if you prize moving-intimate-wonderful-love-songs, if you prize Tony, if you prize the real meaning of Frank, and if you prize the best lyrics and the greatest melodies, then this is the one recording to own.  Hands down.  ""Perfectly Frank"" is perhaps the quintessential ""essential recording.""  Buy this several times over -- you simply cannot go wrong.",132,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"This CD is one of my favourite in my whole collection. Tony Bennetts voice just gets better and better with age, in fact I much prefer his latter day recordings to his early work, which is the total opposite with someone like Frank Sinatra who I think made a collection of music in the 40's and 50's that will forever remain unsurpassed by any other singer. But back to this CD: Others have reviewed the individual tracks, but what really makes this album for me is the overall feeling. If you want to get the atmosphere of a top notch jazz band with, in my opinion, the greatest living jazz singer, playing in your living room then just buy this CD. It really is like having Tony and his band right there with you. The sound is clear, simple and more importantly...wonderful. The songs and the music speak for themselves.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000028RV,"One of the previous reviewers said it perfectly -- Tony Bennett is a  living national treasure. This album is wonderful not because it seeks to  replace Sinatra's classic recordings (that will never happen), but because  it shows first of all how Sinatra chose the best songs to record, and  secondly, that Bennett's voice is still magic.
The singer wisely focuses  on the ""torch and saloon"" songs of Sinatra, which he delivers and  interprets beautifully. It is illuminating to listen to Tony Bennett's  versions of Sinatra classics -- One for My Baby, Angel Eyes, Time After  Time -- and appreciate how he performs the songs while refusing to imitate  Sinatra. The result is pure class, the glowing Tony Bennett and some of the  best songs in the American songbook.
Ralph Sharon has been working with  Bennett for decades, and it shows: class, taste and restraint.

A couple of them come out slightly odd if you think about them in the context of the originals.  For example, the ""Phantom of the Opera"" song is a duet... but they don't play it like a duet - it's a solo vocal.  That's not to say it came out bad - I did give the album five stars - just that it takes a little getting used to for fans of the originals.

That said, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the transformation the songs undergo and the coolness that comes out the other side.  You'll be bobbing your head along in no time.

Standouts on this album (personally) include Science Fiction (from The Rocky Horror Picture Show), Over The Rainbow, and a fantastic rendition of Summertime. Summertime hit me hard when Fantasia Burrino sang it on AI3, which is a powerful song to begin with. Me First accomplish an incredible feat with this song, turning it into punk while retaining its' soul.

Gift_Cards,B00X6G8J3A,As expected.  Arrived on time worked as advertised.,8,6

Gift_Cards,B00X6G8J3A,"This is an excellent product. My husband didn't want me to give our credit card information to Netflix. I did find some stores sell cards for Netflix, but they are not always available.

It is very simple to set up the account and super easy to add a card.

I really like Netflix and am thankful for this easy way to be able to have it.",66,8

Gift_Cards,B00X6G8J3A,This is all I watch is netflix its GREAT has all my favorite shows and more,16,10
Gift_Cards,B00X6G8J3A,Netflix!!! ....so glad this company has become viable!,8,11
Gift_Cards,B00X6G8J3A,What once was cash usable anywhere is now credit usable only 1 place. Yay? Well I bought it with a coupon so I guess its ok.,26,12
Gift_Cards,B00X6G8J3A,"Three stars, since the top and bottom halves of the card separated in transit. This obviously doesn't affect the card usage, but it was a bit annoying to not be able to present the card with its value attached.",39,13
Gift_Cards,B00X6G8J3A,"Netflix gift cards do not work the same as a credit or debit card, where you can pay for a month, cancel, and then restart your membership.
With a gift card, the full amount of the gift card must loaded to your account.  Once the pre-payment is made, Netflix will not cancel your account until it eats through the entire balance.  There is no option to put the account on hold or cancel.  I tried - the message on my account says ""Your membership will be canceled after your gift credit is used up.""  Customer Service said those are the terms of service with a gift card.

If you're a sporadic month-to-month user, stick to using a credit card.",119,14
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"The main character is a little naive in life.  Couldn't really relate to her, but the story is good and I don't regret reading it!  You will love the supporting friend Jax!",32,0
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"This book was much more than I expected it to be.  I loved it so much.  The best types of romance are the kind that start from a spark and develop overtime as friends first.  With the anticipation of it all it just makes for great reading.  I want a Jax in my life.  This book had everything that makes up a great romance novel - love, friendship, companionship, hardship, heartache, drama and frustration.  Speaking of frustration I wanted to jump into the book and smack Cam myself, lol.  You'll understand why when you read it.  Great book, definitely do yourself a favor and read it.",106,1
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"Bre and Jax.......I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book.  It's full of surprises, and, of course, an HEA.  It is sad and happy, and
although you love Cam, his STORY is in another book.  Please read this and continue with the rest of the series.
Congrats,  Lisa Cardiff,  beautifully written.  Thanks for the privilege.",53,2
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"First time reading one of Ms. Cardiff's books and I loved it. Yes, there were parts that were frustrating but that's all in the story telling. If books can't bring out the reader's feelings they aren't doing a very good job writing. Bre had the biggest blinders on of anyone I've seen and Jax had to have the patience of a saint in order to wait for Bre. I'm not sure if I agree with Jax not telling Bre what Cam has been up to but again I don't want things to go as they would in a ""perfect"" story.

I can't wait to get to book #2 in this series. I can only hope it will be as good as the first one!! Looking forward to more rock romance in the future.",133,3
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"Ok, but not enough for me to want to read other installments of the series.",15,4
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"This story was like passing a car crash. You don't want to look but you have to see the end result.
Through the entire book I wanted to roll my eyes and smack the living crap out of Aubrey. Or Bre as she was called.  She was the stupidest, cruelest, clueless dope ever.  We should all be so ignorant and pathetic and still get a happy ending. Of course it's fiction but still.....let's have a heroine with just a smidgen of intelligence and common sense. When you see red flags everywhere then that's a sure sign the Nazis are in town. Duh.",102,5
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"I really enjoyed this story. Jax and Bre were great together. I love the band the romance and the love triangle and, of course, they got their HEA! The twist at the end was an added bonus.",37,6
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,I'm really liking the rock'n roll stories lately and this ones pretty good. The girl is slightly annoying (wake-up!!!) Not the best book I've ever read but a good way to spend some time.,34,7
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"Lisa really captures the reader from the start.  Its a page turner that leaves you wanting more.  Keep writing, and we will keep reading!",24,8
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"I enjoyed the book. Aubrey irritated me with the back and forth. First book read by author, and looking forward to reading more.",23,9
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"Loved it!  I couldn't put it down - it was similar to another book I recently read, but, it definitely worth reading!",22,10
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"Before You by Lisa Cardiff is just good, dirty fun.  With just enough angst and romantic rumblings to keep the pages turning, this book is a very good read.  With strong, lovable characters and a solid story line, it is indeed a must read.",44,11
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"*Spoiler alert*
Bre will drive you absolutely batty in the story! She is so naive to Cam in thinking he's being faithful to her, ha! You really hate Cam a lot through this story, but he redeems himself before the story ends. Jax just sounds delicious in this story! I totally understand Bre being cautious with him, but so glad he proves himself to her!
This story is a romance story, but nothing detailed in the sex scenes. They could have been written a little steamier!
Overall a good read! I will read the next one Redeeming You to see what happens to Cam.",104,12
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,This book just didn't do it  for me.  It seemed to drag on and on.  I  didn't like Bre and couldn't believe that the author would create such a spineless heroine.  The one thing I will say is that it had a happy ending.,44,13
Kindle_Store,B00INIMKKO,"Loved the story and can't wait for the next book. I was taken by Jax and really rather appalled by Cam. I believed that Bre would make the right decision but geez, Cam just kept trying to justify his terrible behavior!! And Katie, what a conniving bitch. Well, all ended well and I recommend this book.",56,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"Live is from Marvin Gaye's 1973 comeback concert in Oakland.  He had not performed live in almost two years at that point and he is a little nervous about his performance.  He shouldn't have worried as he is in top form.  He runs through most of his current hits from the time with ""Trouble Man"", ""Inner City Blues"" and ""Distant Lover"" standing out.  The album contains the only appearance of his ode to his lover ""Jan"".  He seems to strain a bit on the ""Fossil Medley"" and the album's closers ""Let's Get It On"" and ""What's Going On"".  Overall, it is another great album from Mr. Gaye.",107,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"This  excellent  CD  documents one of the greatest  singers,songwriters at their best  coming off one of the most influential  albums  of all times  ""What's Going On"".  Marvin was abscent from the stage  prior to this recorded document some two years.  A performer that  was particularly parnoid about performing live.  What this CD illustrates  is the amazing power  this man  had once he hit the stage.  From the opening strains  of  the overture  to the closing  of What's Goin On  you know  you're in for something of a life time.  As in added  bonus on this  cd  they added  the previously unreleased  Flyin High(In The Friendly Sky)  Mercy Mercy Me(The Ecology),  Keep  Gettin It On,  Introduction To The Orchestra which  didn't appear on the orginal  album verison  or the orginal  Cd verison .  Highlites on this fabolous CD  Trouble Man, "" Distant Lover""  Inner City Blues.  You know what?  the whole  cd  is so wonderful  you really cant pick a highlite.

His legacy will forever live on  pick this up.",199,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"Marvin Gaye was always a favorite of mine for his phrasing, and interpretations and how he could escalate the integrity of the writer's vision (either for himself or other writers). ""Live"" 1974 is one of the few live albums that I treasure because of the musicians (Jamerson, Ray Parker, Ed Greene and the others who also played on the  ""Let's Get It On"" sessions), & the arranger (Gene Page). These were the valuable components of the Motown sound.  Of course, the addition of ""Flyin' High"" is a sweet bonus and this version of ""Distant Lover"" is a classic in itself. I'm usually a favorite of studio music but this is a refreshing metamorphosis that I enjoy from beginning to end, first cut to last.  Needless to say, a lot of the artists and musicians (Gaye and Jamerson in particular) left us too soon so we must enjoy what they left us and be thankful that God blessed us with their enormous talent.",162,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"It's really a lost art.  Gone are the days when top flight soul singers toured with a full ochestra.  The '70's concerts on the R&B scene benefited from the Jazz era (in this case, the big band era) performers.  Believe me, you never hear anything like the Marvin's backup band today.
  Marvin Gaye was never completely comfortable on stage.  His vocals here rarely rises to the full zenith witness on vinly. But then again by the time of ""Let's Get it On"", Gaye had adopted a laid-back approach(which latter on influenced Frankie Beverley) to his music and it is very evident on this live recording.
  Highlights on the album are ""Trouble Man"", ""Distant Lover"" and '60's medley suite.  The two big hits are nothing special and pale considerably to the studio versions.
  For the most part the audio quality is fine, if not a little ""too sweet"".  But even this new remastered CD contains the same annoying mic feedbacks found on the orignal LP.",164,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"What can I say here...Marvin Gaye  is the benchmark for any recording artist whether in the studio or live in concert. Just brilliant! Amazing.!!! The ability to sound live as good,if not better!,than in the studio-wow! and he couldn't even dance. Did he need to? Have the""modern Gods' like Kanye West ever listened to this?Hope he did,sure about Robin Thicke,he listened a lot of MG.Are they anywhere near the level of Marvin?Do not make me laugh!",76,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000060NL,"A review is not worthy of this CD, had I been there, I could tell you. But, based on my concert experience's, I'm sooooooo glad someone took the time & effort to record Marvin Gaye's best ""live concert"" ever, this CD has the best live versions of ""What's Going On & Distant Lover"". When I play these songs, people go back in time to when things were better and we all were young. The women go absolutely crazy! This CD preserves the power of love that only ""Marvin"" could put into words.",92,9

I have run into on occasions, a CD, that had the picture of the Artist, but when I received the CD, it was not the original artist.  This CD was the real thing.  I would tell a friend.  The only reason why I did not give this CD a 5 star rating, is because I did notice a few songs ended a couple of seconds early, or the ending was a slight bit differnt from the Album.

The CD is OK but I really wanted the CD with the song You Want It Back on it. I'll keep the import version but ill probably buy the US version because I like song on the US version. amazon needs to fix their web page for the import CD version too since the song list listed here is wrong.",128,11

I use the CD for jogging, a quick boost on the drive to a soccer game, getting unpleasant chores like paying bills done.
Finding this style of music lead me into finding other quality music like Moby and Fatboy Slim even!  However, with those two highly-recommended exceptions, few other albums have ever had so many quality songs that I have found endlessly repeatable.  Now forever I will be disappointed with finding a CD with only two or maybe three quality songs.  I continue to listen to the CD close to a year after buying it, amazed at the new things I hear and the layers I hadn't noticed before.

I was first attracted to Gordon Lightfoot when I heard ""If You Could Read My Mind"" in 1970-71. I was 12 or 11 years old. The first Lightfoot album I purchased was ""Don Quiote"", and I continue to listen to it to this day. I fell in lov with Gordon's musicianship, both as a composer and a lyricist and his artistry in playing 6 and 12 string guitar. I saw Gordon in concert a half dozen times during the remainder of the 1970's. ""Old Dan's Records"" wasn't in the top five of my favorite Lightfoot albums, but it has some memorable songs: ""It's Worth Believin'"", ""Mother Of A Miner's Child"", and ""Hi'way Songs"" are all top quality. Gordon Lightfoot has remained my favorite singer/songwriter/poet for over 40 years. I have all his albums (downloaded or on CD these days) and many fond memories of his concert performances. His voice was unsurpassed in range and clarity. Like Bob Dylan, when I hear a Gordon Lightfoot song, I just wish it would go on forever.",174,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,How great it is to be able to find CDs that are no longer available elsewhere? It's super.,18,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"Gordon Lightfoot has long been one of my favorite singers and while not his best, ""Old Dan's Records"" is still pretty enjoyable. To me, six of the ten songs are good, with ""It's Worth Believin'"" still being a favorite. That and the title song  can still get your toes tappin' and your head a'noddin' .  ""Lazy Morning"" makes you feel just like the title says. ""You Are What I Am,"" ""Mother of A Miner's Child"" and ""Can't Depend On Love"" are all GOOD, but not GREAT, songs. But with Gordon's rich baritone and the underdone instrumental backgrounds, you'll find yourself liking it anyway.",103,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"One of my favorite of Gord's albums because he's singing his heart even more than usual.

Nothing commercial going on here; no pop tunes, no overt attempts at a single. Instead, the best collection of lyrics Gord ever put on a single album. Each song evokes a particular mood; just the right memories matched lyrically to just the right music.

More than any other GL album, this one makes me feel like I know him.",75,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,Old Dan's Records another classic album from Gordon Lightfoot! If you love Gordon's music from the early 70's you will love this album. The music is still acoustic and this album is an interim album on his way to the massive album Sundown. This album was a bit more of a sleeper in his catalog. No big hits on this one just Old Dan's Records! It is definitely not my favorite album by him but it is classic Lightfoot recorded during his peak! A solid album by a legendary artist. The mastering and sound quality if very good and packaged is no frills but nice. Great Music at a Great price,111,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"While there are other Gordon Lightfoot albums (oops, I'm showing my age) that I like better, I find this album enjoyable too.  His voice is good, and the musicianship is equally good.  There is some soft banjo in the background, which most of his albums do not have.  The words to the songs are included.  Even if they were not included, I can always understand every word he sings on his other albums.  I just love his voice during this time period.

I really like ""Farewell to Annabel,"" ""Old Dan's Records"" (which I first heard on his great ""Gord's Gold""), ""Mother of a Miner's Child,"" and my favorite tune ""You Are What I Am.""  The latter is such an upbeat love song.  I'm glad I added this to my Gordon Lightfoot collection.",132,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,Basically this is a pleasant enough offering but for Lightfoot the songwriting is pretty average.,15,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"'Old Dan's Records' was Gordon Lightfoot's eighth album and the first of two released in '72. The only other year this happened was in '68. I think Gordon may have been looking ahead to his follow-up album later in the year (Don Quixote) because 'Old Dan's Records' is a little lacking when you consider that this was written and recorded during the prime of Gordons' career.

Containing -10 tracks-, there is nothing that really stands out on this album/CD that would be considered classic Lightfoot, or be included on a 'Best Of' collection. It's enjoyable, but it won't get as much playing time when compared to many of his other albums/CD's.",111,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"This is a very good album. It's just difficult to pick up a vibe from it in my opinion. It is hypnotic and I find myself listening to it time and again. Although I can't get the idea out of my head that it's an album made up of afterthoughts.
Some think it's more upbeat,I say it has more of a somber feel to it. The standouts for me are ""Farewell To Annabel"", ""That Same Old Obsession"" and ""It's Worth Believin'"". It has it's high points, but again, to me it's difficult to nail down a vibe.",97,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"It has probably been 25 years since I listened to this album. I couldn't believe how good it sounded. I listened to it about 3 times in a row before I put it aside.

THis does not mean that OD is outstanding in any way! Sure, there are a few gems on here, but so are there on all gord's cd's. He has only himself to blame. If he persists in spoiling us, his audience, with great music, he will get no slack when he's on the downsloap...

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000068VST,"Canadian singer/songwriter/acoustic guitarist Gordon Lightfoot was in the midst of his creative zenith when Old Dan's Records was recorded in 1972. So this album simply rolls from one melodic, emotional highlight to another. For me, so many of these songs echo places and times...the piano driven ballad Same Old Obsession is like a melancholy Victorian-era drama...Lazy Mornin' suggests a idyllic day in the country...and despite its title, Can't Depend On Love has a wonderful lightness to it. What's interesting about this album is the history of its time...in his book Lightfoot: If You Could Read His Mind, author Maynard Collins says Lightfoot was going through marital difficulties in 1972 (yes, they would lead to a divorce) and he was recovering from a serious bout of something called Bell's Palsy. This affliction affects facial muscles, and Collins suggests pictures from that time (including the album cover) were done in such a way to hide the affected part of his face.

The music clarity is great and it is clear that the producers focused on listening quality.,63,9

When Marion Cotillard won the Academy Award this year for ""La Vie En Rose"" I placed the movie on my Wish List and received it as a gift. After watching it I was amazed at and enthralled with Miss Piaf's life and her pure and unique voice.  I also purchased two of her cd's, but this one is the best of the two.  The quality of the cd is excellent and her voice seems more mature and strong.  I treasure this cd and every time I listen to it I think of Edith's life and all of the hardship and obstacles she faced, and the triumph in becoming the most famous and beloved singer in France.",135,14

I am a huge fan of authors like Douglas Adams, Jasper FForde, and Terry Pratchett and this book is in this vein of well thought out scifi/fantasy with a humorous slant. I would recommend this to any fan of the the three authors I mentioned above with the understanding that the author while very good is not as, the best word I can think of right now, refined as the ones I mentioned.

Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,I've enjoyed this series very much.  Mother Shun-Company keeps a close eye (and hand) on her brood while Uncle Humpage tries to keep the small world from being noticed by the outside worlds.  Great book and will continue to keep up on the Small World family.,46,6
Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,I have thoroughly enjoyed both books in the series so far!  I truly did not expect the story to be so far reaching when I began the first book but I really enjoyed following the family Reborn-in-Jesus through a large portion of their entertaining and interesting lives. Enough good science and enough comedy to keep both books moving fast. I would say almost a little too much action and simultaneous plot lines in Littlestar to really do justice to the vast universe the author has created here...but each section is hilarious and/or really interesting. I don't think I have laughed so hard at the thought of all of mankind on the brink of extinction since Douglas Adams which says a whole lot for Mr Green 's accomplishments as an author.  PLEASE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!,136,7

Do yourself a favor and just go ahead and get it.",13,10
Kindle_Store,B005NB0QEG,"I bought this after reading the first volume and while finding it readable, I cannot rate it as highly as I had hoped.  The author sees this work as cosmic satire, working in Christian theology, Greek gods, artificial intelligence, and military conflict. There is an interesting core having to do with the conflict between species preservation and species evolution. The depiction of a family of Christian fundamentalist space pioneers is well done and filled with little ironies.

The downside is a confusing story. The confusion lies in creating a world without rules.  The author has created a world where every man-made object can think and act, where time can be manipulated, where telepathic control of others is possible, and where new technologies plop into the story from nowhere. I prefer a story where the author has imagined a different world which operates by different rules which nonetheless form a dysfunctional system that makes its own sense.  Satire should not be a license for confusion.

That said, the author is a brilliant writer with flashes of profound insight expressed in an interesting way.",182,11

Natalie Dessay gives one of the great comic performances ever seen on stage (or even film.) She also sings beautifully. Juan Diego must be one of the great tenors, especially for this period in Opera. I was reading on youtube today that he was not as good as Pavarotti or Kraus. This is Tosh!  Juan Diego sings this part effortlessly.  Buy this and play it to your friends, even though they may profess not to like Opera.",97,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,I just saw the Metropolitan HD live simulcast of La Fille du Regiment yesterday and simply can't get over Nathalie Dessay's performance. Her physical comedy is fabulous and what is truly astounding is how well she sings while being so physically active (non-stop) on stage.  She was a joy to watch.  Florez was also wonderful.,55,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"I remember seeing a traditional La Fille a long time ago; I was bored stiff. But on the strength of the many 5 star reviews, I took a risk on this La Fille.

Don't let the anachronistic setting (WW I?) scare you off; this is one of those cases where it works.

Dessay starts out as a near-manic, but her acting quickly turns the prosaic story into a dramatic hoot.

And then there's Florez' high C's: enough said.

I haven't seen the competing La Fille with Ciofi and Florez, but this one is simply too much fun. Get it.",131,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"This is a funny opera, well performed by all the singers, especially Natalie Dessay, who is quite comical and Juan Diego Florez, who sings his heart out.  Donizetti himself would be proud of this production!",35,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"I first heard this production while driving on a trip. Dessay's Marie and Florez's Tonio are outstanding interpretations and I could hardly wait to order the CD. Well, to my surprise it was available through Amazon as a DVD and was apparently backordered because I had to wait several weeks for it. It was worth the wait. Dessay is an amazing singing actress and vocally superb.",66,4

Bravo ROH for taping this great production. The singing and acting are really wonderful and funny. You'll never regret if you buy this DVD.",49,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"The first time I saw this production, my memory says it was about 15 years ago, at the Met and, at that time, Natalie Dessay looked substantially younger. In fact, when I saw her, my first thought was that there had been a last-minute, unannounced change in the person playing the part of Marie. As she walked on stage, she looked and moved so much like the country -western singer, Reba McIntyre, that I thought it was her, while I wondered what McIntyre was doing in a opera.

 Needless to say, I was wrong, then. This is an excellently portrayed version of this opera, keeping the story, costuming and era in proper perspective. Some of the costumes are a bit silly but, since this is a comic opera, it all fits.

 The quality of the singing is excellent, as well as the acting, making this another I would recommend.",149,6

This is the same production that was put on by the Met in HD, but this is the Covent Garden performance.

This show is somewhat famous for the seven high C's hit by the tenor Juan Diego Florez.",72,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"For singers, especially, this is a spectacular and exciting event.  Seen on the Giant Cinemark screen it was excellent, but scrutiny at one's leisure of the quality and talent of these two artists was breathtaking.  Actually, it wasn't just these two artists.  The Orchestra was spectacular with not a weak spot in the entire opera, crisp, clean execution, and magnificent musicality.  The support singers were also better than you can imagine.  I was unfamiliar with this opera until I saw this production, and can't for the life of me imagine anything more thrilling!  Staging and comedy were not forced, but naturally good humored and beautifully timed.  I bought this and have watched it several times.  It is one of the most inspiring performances I've ever scene.  You'll LOVE it!",129,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"I've never watched this opera and the DVD gave me the opportunity to see Dessay-Florez in action. His is a unique voice perhaps suited to comic opera [Okay, now I'll duck], but having enjoyed his performance in ""Le Comte Ory"" [Met HD LIVE], I wanted to see this. Being aware that the setting was, for want of a better word, fastforwarded to early 19th century, this did not detract too much, but the overabundance of movement did. Dessay really was like a wound-up doll [goodness, she even had the looks of one, sorry!] unwinding at frenetic pace. My husband was asking, what's with the modern iron and board?

Two lovely singers with worthy instruments that might have been better applied by another director.",123,10

After having seen Natalie Dessay as the tragic Lucia Di Lammermoor, it was amazing to see her comedic performance as Marie, the mascot of the regiment. The lyric beauty of her voice is as astonishing as her Chaplinesque routines. She is the Tomboy daughter of the regiment, ironing their clothes, peeling their potatoes while singing of her love for her adopted ""fathers."" In addition to Dessay's breathtaking coloratura arias, Juan Diego Florez's effortless nine high Cs make this opera a veritable showstopper.  The melodies are glorious, the singing and acting are flawless. Donizetti must have had a ball poking fun at his own tragic operas. My only disappointment was the unimpressive set design, which did not detract from my overall enjoyment.",144,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0013V33DG,"This opera and this production redefine the term ""frothy entertaiment."" Dessay and her colleagues play it for laughs, but what else can you do with Donizetti's material? Don't worry about the time shifting, and don't try to impose any historical chronology on the production -- it seems vaguely set during the first world war, but were the French fighting in the Tyrol in that conflict? Not to my knowledge, though Napoleon's troops were there in 1809-10. Did Napoleon's troops have tanks? Unlikely. Don't worry, and don't expect the kinds of deep insights into humanity that you will get from the operas of Mozart, among others. Enjoy the froth and the foam, enjoy Florez and his rendition of ""Ah, mes amis!"" enjoy Dessay, the comedienne with a spectacular voice, and all the others.",132,14

If I hadn't spent the first half of the book waiting for it to take off in a direction it was never heading, I probably would've enjoyed it more. I wouldn't call this book a sci-fi adventure... it's more of an existential meander built on a sci-fi chassis. It is strange and weird and doesn't develop in the directions you expect it to. If you sit down to read it expecting some philosophical explorations and hypothetical moral questions instead of a space opera, you'll probably enjoy it.",105,0

I discovered one day that he hates the books I loved (and books everyone else apparently loved), so I decided to check out other books rated poorly by him.

This is one of the more creative scifi's (as has been mentioned before, futuristic dystopia scifi) and I didn't notice any overt similarities to other books I've read.  The writing style is enjoyable and immersive, though sometimes a little inconsistent but that it more than made up for by the story.

This book might be great to some while leaving others to scratch there heads in confusion. The author must have received a bit of criticism since he goes out of his why to explain segments of the story via addendum. This almost reminds me of 2001 Space Odyssey when Arthur C Clark wrote the book AFTER the movie was released in order to explain what was going on. Of course Turkot is no Arthur C Clark especially when it comes down to the science of the story. In that respect the feel of the novel to me at least seemed retro, like the old fashioned X-1 stories of the 50s.",131,9

I was suckered by a discount in the price of admission - I see that the price has gone back up - save your money is all I can say on that one.  This book starts out mediocre and gets worse from there on out.  Although there are a few interesting ideas, the plot is muddled, the characters under-developed and un-nuanced and the editing dreadful, even for a kindle book.  In no time at all the plot gets bogged down if not lost in what appears to be some very hurtful issues surrounding child-abuse.  Yikes.  It felt burdensome after awhile.  I read sci-fi to escape.  Oh and any book that offers a hyperlink that leads to an explanation of what the hell is happening in the book - oh man take that as a big Red Flag warning.",146,12

Virtually NO character development,  explanations, or possibility of feeling empathy for anyone in this novel!  I really felt like there were no good guys or bad guys - just people and robots stumbling around stupidly, getting in the way and dying for it.
Would/could have been a decent premise, but the lack of a coherent and intelligent story ruined it completely.

What a Lady requires by Ashlyn Macnamara was well written.  It held my interest from the beginning until the end.  The story had me laughing and smiling in many parts.

The heroine was smart and feisty and much more likable.  Together they kept secrets from each other and it all became a bit boring.

The characters were well fleshed out but the plot seemed tacked together with random scenes.  Side characters were from previous books in the trilogy and added to the story.  Although this book can be read as a standalone, reading the two books before it will add to the enjoyment.

I received this book free for review from the publisher.",109,7

Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,Each of this authors books have been great. This one is too. I love the ending as it fills my need of facts,23,8
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,I read the book leading up to this one for free and liked it enough to buy this one.  This time the author disappointed me.  The book jumps around between the two main characters into the past and back to the present withouth any clarity of who I'm reading about.  It takes several sentences if not a whole paragraph to figure that out.  On top of that none of the characters drew me in.  Frankly I didn't care what happened to any of them.,84,9

Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,"Again, an OK book.  Its tells us what happened to Aryl while he was missing.  It is a story that also combines Richard Sloan, a detective for missing persons.  Richard is telling us his story and Aryl is also recounting his.  Neither seem to be telling in chronological order, so it gets a  bit confusing.  Like Elizabeths Heart, a lot of it seems irrelevant.  That being said, I stuck with it, because Aryl was part of the original group, and I did care about those characters and what happened to them.  I will probably buy the next one, when it comes out, because I hate leaving loose ends, but I hope it stays a bit more on events as they are unfolding and the characters reactions to it, rather than off into things on central or lala land stuff.",139,12
Kindle_Store,B00FITGVIS,An interesting study of human nature and of the problems of the time.  You want to read all the books.,20,13

Kindle_Store,B00H0LAI3Q,"Don't be deceived by the simplicity of these mini-missions, their power is huge.
If you're familiar with Courtney Carver's website, Be More With Less, then you might already be familiar with her mini-missions. They usually take only a few minutes, and have the power to dramatically change/improve something in your life, especially those little niggles you seem to be unable to shake!
In this collection, Courtney pulls together some trailblazers in modern minimalism/simplicity, covering a wide range of topics.
I'd have thought it's pretty much impossible to read this and not write down at least a handful of mini-missions you want to get started on straight away.
Highly recommended!",109,1

Kindle_Store,B00H0LAI3Q,The book spoke straight to my heart. Courtney is a gifted writer and her advise comes from her experience. The ideas are practical and easy to apply to your every day life. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for ways of simplifying and enjoying life.,49,8

Here's a book which teaches you how to reach simplicity, in every aspect of your life, by taking small actions, one at the time, at your own pace.

Over the last six months I've implemented a few of these micro-actions into my daily life with great satisfaction. Some have been easier than other but all of them have slowly unraveled the beauty and freedom of Living More with Less.

It's a challenge, it's counterintuitive at times, but you can't go wrong, you can always go back (should you ever wish to), and you can start now. Try it.",114,10

Kindle_Store,B007IPTXQ2,"I was watching ABCTVs First Tuesday Book Club the other day and Judy Nunn was sharing her thoughts about several books. I was so impressed with her observations that I thought she must be a good writer because she understood a book's ""big picture"", so I decided to seek out some of her work.  I came across ""The Wardrobe"" at a very reasonable price. Instead of adding it to my very long wish list I bought it immediately, started reading and didn't want to put it down.  Loved it. I'm looking forward to reading more of her work.",98,1
Kindle_Store,B007IPTXQ2,"This was an easy read but I didn't find it all that interesting and it bwas a bit short. I had previously read Di Morrissey""s ""The Golden Land"" and the main idea was similar in both books. I enjoyed the latter book more.",43,2

Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"I really wanted to love this book. I am a huge fan of the author, but this one just fell short for me. The synopsis pulled me in, but the actual story moved so fast I couldn't keep up. I felt like I needed to have more of a relationship established between Lindy and Lucas before the big mess up that tears them apart. Because the mess up is HUGE!! I didn't really feel they had a strong friendship to start with, so when the THING happens I hated Lucas so much I wasn't able to really relate to the characters afterwards. I had a hard time believing Lucas after Lindy came back in to his life. He does some really crappy things and I just couldn't find a way to really like him again.  I really liked the storyline and I think for me if I could have gotten a better sense of them before I could have gotten in to it more, but without the background I really found myself not loving this one. I love Emily Minton and this will not keep me from reading the next book. I look forward to reading about Tara and Daniel.",200,0

Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"I was amazed at this book. It was well written and a roller coaster of emotion and suspense. I found this to be a sweet book of friendship, betrayal, forgiveness. Melinda (Lindy Lou) is sweet, smart, overweight and not popular at all. Shes bullied at school (called piglet) and Lucas doesnt even stick up for her. She came across really nave and too forgiving of Lucas all the time. She accepted his friendship anyway he provided it to her because she was secretly in love with him. But then one night changes everything. I loved the story line between Lucas and Melinda but I hated Lucas at the beginning of this book. It took alot for me to change my opinion of him. But thank god he turned into a nice guy after everything.

Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,"There are moments of sweetness sprinkled in this friends-to-lovers romance and then there are chunks of complete douchery.

I feel like this is a story that I should have read when I was 16 as a manual of what kind of guy to steer clear from because he is dysfunction wrapped up in the prettiest package.

The relationship was really annoying to me and the way Lucas and Lindy came back together was more than badly clich&eacute;, BUT that had nothing to do with the writing skills of Ms. Minton.  She painted a fair and accurate picture of all that was irritatingly realistic in these characters.",106,9

Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,This was terrible. The storyline itself was creative but the story was underdeveloped. It's like the author just got lazy. I am so confused as to why this got such high reviews. It was really not good. The characters were not even likeable.,43,12
Kindle_Store,B00FGDYLI8,I've been waiting for this book since reading the prologue a few weeks ago. Definitely worth the wait and enjoyed the story and all the characters (even the hateful ones)!

I have friends and family that are either veggie only or gluten intolerant foodies, so I was especially happy with Kit's tips in that regard so that I can prepare meals everyone will enjoy without suffering taste. And I have never considered nutmeg on avocado--but it works! I bought a whole nutmeg and grated it right onto the avocado. It's as easy as making lemon zest. There are no more than a dozen meals in this book--but they will all become your favorites.",111,0

  The tomato soup, pesto lasagna and fish & chips were fun to make and tasted great. I love Miller's tone -- friendly, encouraging and no-nonsense at the same time. She sprinkles in a few facts about herself here and there that made me want to know more about her, as much as I wanted to learn more of her recipes. The emphasis on budget meals shouldn't scare away the gourmands out there. The couscous-stuffed beef tomatoes and Milanese chicken should impress any guest.

Now to try the mint-flavored chocolate mousse!",130,2

This book gets five stars from me for its clear, precise instructions as well as the useful information which supports each recipe and the book as a whole.
And I must just add: the food is yummy and as cheap as the book says!",120,3

My wife is always looking for something different for supper. We get bored with the same old things over and over, and we feel it our duty to expose our children to more than just hamburgers, hotdogs, and hot-pockets (even though they're very finicky). For such an inexpensive book, Kat Miller has done a beautiful job displaying the recipes and making serving suggestions. We have taken the sample calendar and plan to try at least one of the recipes each week, in place of whatever mundane meal would normally be thrown together. Our first attempt was the Milanese Chicken, and it was an instant hit with my wife, our youngest, and myself! Delicious! I have recommended that my mother, a caterer, get this book. I'm sure that despite her hundreds of collected recipes, ""Delicious Meals for 1.22 Euros"" must surely have several recipes she's not seen before. Thank you, Kat for such a worthy read!",179,7

""This is bloody obvious, but..."" Yes, sometimes we do need the obvious spelled out-- especially with cooking. The recipes look delicious, though some of the photos are less than crisp. The book is geared towards the European cook-- ingredients are measured in ounces and pounds, for example, and there is mention of 'gas mark 4' for the temperature of the stove. I was intrigued to learn that ""profiteroles' are kind of like cream puffs. The book is a look into culture as well as good food.

Kindle_Store,B00D42C6Q2,"There are literally thousands of cook-books out there but very few that emphasize the feasibly edible over the intensely fancy and labor-intensive, not to mention pricey, dishes.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to squeeze a little more value from their food budget, from college students to people on Social Security. I believe anyone can find at least three main courses in this book that will be a beneficial addition to their standard repertoire...not to mention the desserts!

A side-benefit is Kat's charts, demonstrating the honest advantages and disadvantages to each dish, as well as how to alter them for various needs. I've never seen this in a cook-book before and it is a great innovation! She has kindly including American measurements as well as European, for which I thank her.",168,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"MYSD represents the groups sophomore effort, and it's obvious that they did not want to fall into a sophomore slump. They worked really hard to put a lot of new experiences into this record to differentiate it from Gordon.  The band's unconventional approach to its subject matter keeps the songs  fresh and vital over repeated playings - like a complex movie that you get  a little more out of every time you watch it. From a sales perspective, it  did not soar to the heights of Gordon, but it is clear that the Ladies  really enjoyed performing the songs on this album. Rumor has it that the  new album, Maroon, which is being produced by Don Was, has a MYSD quality  to it, which is great news for BNL fans.",130,1

If you are a mainstream-pop type of person and like BNL's singles like ""Jane,"" ""Brian Wilson"" and ""Pinch Me,"" the ""Maybe You Should Drive"" album is worth getting.",79,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"The Barenaked Ladies are the greatest band on the face of the earth, and although this CD isn't my favorite BNL CD, Just because it's BNL it has to get 5 stars in my book.

The Barenaked Ladies are a very talented quintet who can make good clean fun music. Too many bands today are too serious, not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that...Okay, so there is something wrong with that. BNL is my favorite band and they'll always lift up your mood, why do drugs when you can get the same affect from listening to BNL? If you don't have any BNL CD's yet, buy Gordon first, then buy my favorite, ""Maroon"" with ""Pinch Me"" and ""Too Little, Too Late"".

It really stood out amongst all the other songs being  played, because its lyrics were smart and funny, and the music was great.  When I found out they were Canadian, that sealed it -- I had to get the  album.  I am Canadian and I favor Canadian artists.  I listened to it over  and over and find it hard to say which tracks are the best.  They're all so  good!  I shared it with a friend who said their musicianship was  outstanding.  Me, I just love the catchy songs, that sound so different  than anything else being played.  It's refreshing!  I recommend this album  to anybody who likes to hear something different, that's quality.  Most  musicians probably don't like comparisons, but to give an idea about these  guys, I would say the combination of excellent musicianship and witty  lyrics could ""compare"" them to Steely Dan on a happier, more fun  level.  I have since bought 2 more BNL albums but this one still stands out  as the best, with ""Stunt"" a close second.  Carry on guys, you're  great!  You have a long and prosperous future.",201,6

With a wide variety of  heartfelt lyrics (You'll Be Waiting & Jane) to funny tunes that keep  you smiling (A & Life in a Nutshell) the cd is very well rounded.  I  purchased it from one of those funky mail-in cd clubs hoping it would  contain the smash hit If I had $100,000,000.  I had heard the song on the  radio, found out about the band and fell completely in love, but...to my  dismay the song didn't appear on the track list.  I popped the album in my  stereo anyway and have been a devoted BNL fan ever since.  I bought the  remainder of bnl cds and discovered my favorite band of all time.  Maybe  You Should Drive is a defintie must for anyone even slightly interested in  the sweetly addicting Bare Naked Ladies.",201,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"Two of the songs on this album (Everything Old is New Again and The Wrong Man Was Convicted) got me through a particularly difficult breakup with my girlfriend at the time.  Needless to say, this album has a special place in my collection.  It's a good listen all-around, and if you're in a difficult emotional state like I was, it may strike a chord with you as well.  BNL has always been one of my favorite bands, and this album is a prime example of the way that BNL pours their collective heart and soul into their work.",98,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"Coming after their classic debut ""Gordon"", this was quite a  switch for Steve, Ed and the rest of the boys. Where as ""Gordon""  was mostly full of funny, quirky songs. ""Maybe You Should Drive""  is a much more personal album, that shows that BNL is about a lot more then  just being goofy. It shows that they can write some truly beautiful songs.  this cd is not only my favorite BNL album, but my favorite album period. It  still has their trademark sense of humor through-out, but it deffinitely  shows a different side to these guys...and further proves that Barenaked  Ladies are without a doubt the best band out there today!",111,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"All of the songs are classic. ""Life, In a Nutshell"" is my favorite song by them. ""These Apples"" is amazing. If you don't own this, you're missing out on a lot...",31,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"This gets four stars only because the wackiness that epitomized Gordon is totally gone in this follow-up album.  Possibly because they changed Producers (from Wojewoda to Mink) the sound is the same, but the subject matter is quite a bit different.  Also new are a couple songs that I could do without.  These Apples and A are not (IMHO) the strongest tracks, but I wouldn't skip them consistently.  Particular favorites are Jane, Everything Old Is New Again, and Life, In A Nutshell.  This album seems more moody than Gordon, probably because while the cleverness in the songwriting is still there, the whimsical subject matter is absent.",106,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MT4,"To this CD that is.  Maybe You Should Drive and Stunt are my favorite BNL recordings.  They are more mature than Gordon, but still pleasingly playfull.  BNL are a refreshing experience compared to so much loud, heavy, hateful rap-metal-punk bands these days.  These Canadians continue to prove their musical and lyrical talents.  This is a good buy.  4 stars.",59,14

This book was intense in parts and the drama kept me turning the pages. Some excellently written love scenes made this story stand out and I have no trouble recommending it to anyone who loves a book that shows an emotional side, whilst being real and honest about sexual relationships.
Elysa is a likeable character, and I felt and cared for her more and more as the story went on, as she struggled with her feelings toward Alex in this exciting, dramatic and steamy romance.
Recommended.",97,2
Kindle_Store,B00EF4RPSC,"Alex is an intense person but he's also protective, ""she's mine. You put your hands on her again and I'll effing break them.""

Besides practically ignoring me all day, you then felt it was okay to insult me during the entire meeting. And  to top it all off, now you're making accusations about me and Joseph!"" She's a spitfire and what's on her mind comes out of her mouth, ""talk? Are you effing kidding me? I've been trying to talk to you for four days! Any one of those days would have been the time to talk. You chose to blow me off, ignore me, and treat me like another notch on your belt.""

It was so predictable and the story had no flow, none at all. I also thought she was a word repeat offender. How many times must one use the same words over and over and over in scene? I think  this books lacks creativity, story line and character personalities. It was not a book that will have you crying unless like me you are livid you spend $3.99 on crap.",94,4

Elyssa Hart, a down to earth woman with her own history to deal with, now has much more than she bargained for with her love interest, and influential man, Alexander James. What Alex wants he absolutely always gets, and what he wants is Ely. And the way he goes about it, is domineering and hot.
This is a story of practical love, a love that doesn't feel fictional. I felt as if I knew the characters personally, as if Ely was me or my best friend, and her feeling were honest; they read true. Alex's passion for his family, work and love made you want to know more about where his life has lead him and how the outcomes have shaped his life.
Chosen Heart is a romance that has you wanting this beautiful relationship to evolve and makes you feel like love does exists in this powerful way. Chosen Heart is a dramatic, sometimes action packed, love story that I did not want to stop reading.",181,11

My only problem is that we are STILL waiting for the second book and haven't gotten a date for it, just 2014.

Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"""The Physician"" was outstanding.  Every page was an adventure, and I hated for it to end.  ""Shaman"" started off good, but bogged down in the middle, reading more like a textbook, but ended OK.  ""Matters of Choice""?  YUCK!  Read like a soap opera.  Couldn't wait for it to end.  I couldn't believe it was written by the same author.",59,8
Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,Shaman  was also  very historical accurate  and  gave a good history of  matters during the Civil War.  Was disappointed in Matters of Choice.

Kindle_Store,B0090WS03I,"The first book of the trilogy was interesting, took place in the 11th century with wonderful descriptions of the special gift the main character had as well as descriptions of life, cultural differences and education in the area we now call the middle east. The 2nd book took place during the expansion of America toward the west; the characters were fairly well defined and the premise of the ""special gift"" was explored along with interaction among the Native American and different ethnic values. The story ended with the civil war. It was a good book but not special. The 3rd book took place in more contemporary times. I felt it was a little too much like a ""coming of age soap opera""  It was entertaining like a summer beach novel. I can't give it more than 3 stars due to the lack of character development and conceptual premise behind the 2nd and 3rd books.",154,10

I really enjoyed learning about the early days of medical practices and it was very interesting how religion played a significant part in what was accepted and what wasn't.

Following a family from 1030 to current day is not an easy task but choosing three points in time during this span, Gordon illustrated his research capability and made the main characters come to life really well.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"I consider ""A Medio Vivir"" to be one of Ricky Martin's two best CDs (the other one being the superb ""Vuelve""). This CD of Latin pop contains many well-crafted songs, all performed with skill and enthusiasm by the versatile Martin. He can play it smooth or belt it out like a true male diva--whatever the song calls for. All of the lyrics are in Spanish.
As a whole, the songs on ""A Medio Vivir"" are a diverse bunch. ""Corazon"" has a disco feel, and ""Revolucion"" has an edgier rock sound. ""Bombom de Azucar"" has delightfully playful rhythms and lyrics. ""Maria"" is the most obviously Latin of the songs, with its strongly percussive instrumentation and overall tropical flavor. Ricky's performances are especially strong on the emotional ballads: ""Volveras,"" ""Te Extrano,"" and ""Fuego de Noche.""
""A Medio Vivir"" is an essential disc for fans of Latin pop. And those who are only familiar with Ricky's English-language work should definitely check out this disc. His energy transcends language barriers.",166,2

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"Ricky's best album is (arguably) still his 1999 (US) ""Ricky Martin"" with its hit ""Livin La Vida Loca"", but this one is still my favorite. Ricy's rich voice soars on tracks such as Te Extrao, Te Olvido, Te Amo and leaves us wanting more with every note. A fine actor as well as a singer, Ricky sang this song on ""General Hospital"" and had me gasping. Gloria Estefan helped bring Latino pop into the mainstream, but I believe that it's Ricky who will take it to its highest success. Highly recommend this album for any Latin music fan, Ricky Martin fan, or anyone who wants to listen to true romance. Also check out his 1991 ""Ricky Martin"" album",118,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002E0T,"I bought this CD after the Grammys hoopla, and after buying Vuelve and Ricky Martin (99). I was so caught up in the energy surrounding those two albums, I didn't even pay attention to the more mid-tempo and rock sounds  of A Medido Vivir (AMV).
However, after picking it up several months  later, I must admit that this is my favorite Ricky Martin CD (followed by  Vuelve and Ricky Martin-99). AMV is, argumentatively, his best album. It is  also a very transitional album. Here he becomes the mature ballader we all  know and love, and pushes the bubblegum to the side.
Even if you can not  speak Spanish (and I CAN NOT), you will enjoy AMV and Vuelve very much. The  passion and soul of his music, and his talent shine through all of the  ""flash-in-the-pan"" sentiment from the American media. Don't take  Ricky Martin 99 as a collection of his definitive sound, because it is not.",157,9

Roy Clark plays a me-e-e-ean 5-string, and so does Buck Trent, which makes this particular offering wirklich wunderbar!  (That's truly wonderful, for you who don't know German.)

Roy proves himself to be a master with his hard driving banjo style particularily the double banjo pieces with Trent.  However, some songs have drums and even keyboards, which, when coupled with banjo, yield a bizarre ragtime sound.  I don't want to sound like the bluegrass police or anything, but some stuff on this CD like ""beerbarrel polka"" are definitely not bluegrass. Still, it's well worth listening to.",85,4

I've always been lukewarm about Roy Clark, wondering ""Why on earth did Hee Haw showcase Roy Clark when they had melodic-style originator Bobby Thompson around?"", but this CD changed my mind about him. Neither Roy or Buck have a reputation as innovators, but when I found out that this album first came out in 1978, I have to concede that it was well ahead of its time. While it may have been jarring for bluegrass purists then, it is wonderfully mainstream now, thanks in part to the banjo ""stream"" being widened considerably by the subsequent explorations of Tony Trischka and Bela Fleck.",134,6

The highlight of the cd is Beer Barrel Polka which is generally associated with accordian music.  And these guys have about as much to do with Polka as Weird Al has with country.  But they pull it off.  Being an instrumental cd though.  Nothing else really stands out to me.  And all these songs kind of sound the same.  I do feel like I said before that their other album should be released on cd.  Really I think that all of Roy Clarks records should be released on cd.  At least all of his stuff from the '70s.,130,11

The main song ""A Way Back Into Love"" is sweet and romantic without being overly so, while the songs by Haley Bennet are a poignant twist on the songs done by early Britney and Christina (though I personally love ""Buddha's Delight"" as a regular song). This CD is a definite must buy, but make sure you go see the movie as well.",106,12

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,"This album is so Christmasy!  I love it.  It also has some wonderful music that is traditionally German that I was unfamiliar with until I heard Schmidt's arrangements.  Susser de Glocken is fantastic.  I also love his arrangements of Bring a Torch... and I Saw Three Ships.  Two of the funnest pieces on the album.  Christmas Medley is an excellent combination of What Child is This, We Three Kings (which never sounded better than it does here), and Carol of the Bells.  Where You There and Stars Were Gleaming are two very beautiful pieces that many may not have heard before, beautifully arranged here.",104,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,"This by far is my favorite Jon Schmidt album, and one of my favorite Christmas albums of all time. If you like Fresh Aire Christmas albums, you will love this. Each song is so melodious and perfectly written to bring out the Christmas spirit, which is does so extremely well. These songs take on a new, refreshing life in this album, and it just plain soothes the soul and makes you feel good all over, wishing that Christmas would never end. The time and effort Jon put into this album makes this a Christmas classic for years to come, for young and old alike, and leaves me hoping that another Christmas Jon Schmidt CD follows soon.",116,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,"This is my favorite Christmas album!  It is so beautiful that I gave it as a gift to many friends several years ago.  The music is timeless, and I enjoy playing it throughout the year.  A very peaceful, calming album.",40,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,"This is one of those great Christmas albums that is perfect for listening to when driving around looking at Christmas lights, or while enjoying your own Christmas tree, or baking Christmas goodies, or... well, you get the idea.

Jon Schmidt has added his flair to some Christmas classics, and the result is nice, calming, touching Christmas music.  Gotta love it.",60,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,The music on this CD encapsulates the Christmas spirit while having a nice blend of familiar tunes and less familiar ones.  I also enjoyed getting the sheet music and playing these songs myself during Christmas time.  My parents loved it too.,41,5

This music creates the perfect ambiance.",29,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,"An excellent CD. I enjoy listening to it as background to those busy Christmas prep days that I wish would slow down. It is pleasant and calming. Jon combines a few of his own creations with a few traditional Christmas melodies. His arrangements of ""I Saw Three Ships"" and ""Were you There?"" and ""Bring a Torch, Janette Isabella"" are my favorite arrangements of any out there.",66,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,I very much enjoy listening to this album.  It is great for background music during Christmas festivities. I like the fact that it has several more unusual Christmas songs in it which reduces redundancy in my Christmas playlist.,38,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,I own every one of Jon Schmidt's CD's and every one of his piano books.  Jon Schmidt's music takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.  You can be laughing at his bumblebee song one minute and trying to see through your tears the next.  For anyone who likes new-age music that is very inspiring and uplifting I would highly recommend any of Jon's music.,65,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000CAGSO0,"I have a lot of Christmas music.  From choirs, to vocal solos to orchestras and so on.  This CD is near the top of the list.  It is one of my favorites to listen to at Christmas time.  When I pull out the Christmas music every year it is the 1st one I listen to.  It is perfect to start the season with and for me listening to it marks the beginning of the Christmas season.  Jon makes these Christmas melodies exciting and fresh and yet there is a simple, beautiful tone and quality to them.  Add in a few of his own creations and you have one of the best Christmas CDs ever.",114,14

IS VERY GOOD TO RELAX AND (SORRY) TO MAKE LOVE",21,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"Not as consistently excellent as ""The Long Black Veil"", but buy this album for three great songs: ""The Lowlands of Holland"" (Natalie Merchant uses her beautiful voice with great subtlety), ""I Know My Love"" (The Corrs' version is irresistible; the lead vocal is reminiscent of Debbie Harry on some of Blondie's most upbeat songs), and ""Raglan Road"" (Joan Osborne's voice can break your heart, and it's just as devastating here as on the best songs from ""Relish""). A CD with three great songs is better than one with twelve good ones! The rest of the album is fun to listen to, but not memorable.",104,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"What a waste of money!  The whole CD is a disappointment.  The songs all lack emotion, and the singers do not perform at their best.  This is certainly one to pass up.",32,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"Such deep emotion, such a unique blending of styles....  Such innovation from a talented band of old guys.  My only complaint is that they don't put out more albums.",29,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"It's easy to get overloaded on The Chieftains -- they've recorded so much that I sometimes start to think of them as part of the grand museum of Irish culture, but then I listen, and it's always fresh.  This is a very polished band that has the gift of sounding spontaneous (see Beausoleil for a Cajun equivalent).  Here are a bunch of sad songs sung by women singers who have made reputations in rock or folk or country, not necessarily Irish (Sinead O'Connor being an exception).  It's very well done on the whole, with the lower women's voice's doing particularly well.  Bonnie Raitt and Joan Osborne do tremendous jobs, the latter with a ""Raglan Road"" that would be too slow if it wasn't so good.  Joni Mitchell is powerful in the ""Magdalene Laundries,""  and Sissel and Sinead also do well.  Sounding a bit fragile vocally, but still effective, are Natalie Merchant and Lorena McKennit.  One disappointment is Diana Krall's ""Danny Boy.""  It's too breathy and there are semi-parlando effects that I don't care for.  It's a great melody -- just let it flow!",183,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,This is a very poor effort. Does not rate a second listening.,12,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"I love The Chieftains and was really looking forward to hearing this CD.  While it is good, I was a bit disppointed with it too...the songs individually are fine, but the general tone of the album is too slow and somber.  I feel it needs more variety.  As I listen to it from start to finish, I find myself getting a bit depressed by it.

Some highlights are Saki in the Jar, The Magdelaine Laundries and the long instrumental set The Fiddling Ladies...

Remember though that I am judging this against the standards of other Chieftains albums which is a very high standard indeed...If you are seeking an introduction to their music, I would suggest ""The Long Black Veil""...or ""An Irish Evening""",122,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"I'll start off by saying that I dig the fact that these guys after performing for 40-odd years together are still looking for new ways to express themselves.  They refuse to be a cliche or to stagnate.  I just saw them here in Reno this past weekend and while it felt a little sad to not have Derek Bell and Martin Fay up there, they still played with great energy and passion.  Those guys never mail it in......

Having said that, this one wasn't my favorite.  I felt many of the tunes were a little slow and one-note.  I just couldn't get passionate about their efforts here....it felt a little flat.  The real spunk came from the Corrs who play a lively and fresh version of ""I know my love"" and ""Sake in the jar"" had real wit.  ""Never give all the heart"" a song and word rendition of the Yeats poem was haunting.  So I guess you could say some of the parts were truly brilliant (it's The Chieftains after all!) but ""the whole"" just never quite clicked for me.",181,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"Words cannot describe how terrible this albulm is. I bought it for a version of Raglan Road, and there is one good song of about 10 minutes that is a great classic fiddle and guitar jam, but the rest is down right depressing and awful music. Some of the lyrics talk of fathers raping their daughters.... Not your traditional Irish and Chieftans music to say the least. Stay away.",69,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"This effort by the Chieftains is joyless. It is aptly named for it will surely depress you. We listened to it once and never took it out again. In fact, this is a good reminder to myself to throw it out.",41,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000I5G0,"I bought this for the Diana Krall cover of ""Danny Boy"" and that cut alone has proven to be worth twice the price.  (Hard to get through the song without moist eyes.)
But I was very pleasantly surprised and rewarded by most of the other pieces.  Although I have never been a huge Joni Mitchell fan, her ""Magdalene Laundries"" is quite nice. ""Factory Girl"" by Sinead O'Conner is mezmerizing.  But Joan Osborne was really the surprise for me.  I had seen her on TV a few times and never took much notice but her angelic voice on ""Raglan Road"" blew me away.  On the strength of that, I ordered ""Relish"" and ""Righteous Love"" and have not been disappointed.  (Warning: Osborne will sound like many different women!  It's uncanny!)",128,13

How to over come those and see what is in front of you the entire time. How listening to you gut instead of other shows you the road to take and admiting when your wrong allows you to find your love and happiness.,85,7
Kindle_Store,B00H2VQ860,"I enjoyed ""Honeymoon with a Prince"".  Nicole Burnham writes a fast paced, interesting book.  Her characters are intelligent--the women have their own style and usually their own business and are not so fluffy that they are not believable.  Ms. Burnham makes the characters come alive and I like them--the story is wishful thinking but you think just maybe this could be real!!
Thanks for writing such a thoughtful story.",69,8
Kindle_Store,B00H2VQ860,"First, I don't care if you are a prince.  If you were a man, you don't just walk away when a women just just had sex with all night, is dealing with the police and getting arrested.

Second, the women is a weak door mat who allows men to walk all over her.  You forgave for walking away, you were in jail.  Does she have any pride, no she just wants to have sex with him again.

Third how stupid are you.  I hate reading stupid b.s.  You say she is a smart business women.  Any dumb person knows when you call off the wedding, you take your money and make sure they can't touch it.  You want me to believe she continued to have a joint account with him and she put all her money in the joint account and not her back up account.

Why do you make women look stupid, that whole mess was completely unbelievable.  I stopped reading at that point.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B002E2QHAY,"I'd been hearing ""Champagne"" throughout the summer on rock radio. I saw the video on Fuse a couple of times as well and found myself singing/humming/whistling the hook all the time. On a whim, I checked out Cavo's myspace page and listened to a couple more of the songs. I randomly decided to pick up this disc one day, and I am I ever glad I did...

Cavo blends some great rock hooks, with solid lyrics, and a sound that would fit on rock or pop/rock radio. The tracks ""Champagne"", ""Let it Go"", ""Cry Wolf"", ""Ghost"" and ""Little Secret"" are all excellent tunes. I also enjoy ""Beautiful"" and ""We All Fall Down"".

I think touring with Daughtry is a great move for them, too. While all of Daughtry's fans aren't necessarily rock fans, Cavo has enough of a radio-friendly tone to their music to appeal to a wide variety of fans.

If you like Daughtry, T.O.A.D., Shinedown, Hinder, or Three Days Grace, Cavo is right up your alley.",168,8

I'm not surprised to hear they opened for ""Daughtry"" as they have a similar style overall.  If you like that, you might not be disappointed.  I was hoping for more of a ""Sick Puppies"", whose ""You're Going Down"" was more exemplitive of the overall tone of their CD ""Tri-Polar"".",73,11

Quite simple, Much talent, great music for a couple of listens, not perfect but a tremendously well crafted debut. Won't get into details with songs as I liked them all. Great sound and melodies, amazing voice as well. Cry wolf is one of the best melodic songs here, very recommended.!!!!!",69,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B002E2QHAY,"With their first major release with Warner Bro./ Reprise, Cavo is setting themselves up for a bright future.  Their first song from the album, Champagne, is worth the price for admission alone.  Let It Go, from the Transformer's 2 Soundtrack may sound more familiar to some, but Champagne will stay with you much long.  The album is produced by David Bendeth of Breaking Benjamin and Paramore fame and has a very modern feel. Other songs of note are Cry Wolf, We all Fall Down and the song Ghost which was co-written by Zac Meloy of the Nixons.
From St. Louis, the band is made up of Casey Walker (lead singer), Chad LaRoy (drummer), Chris Hobbs (guitarist) and Brian Smith (bassist).  If you are looking for a new and upcoming band, check out Cavo.  Better yet, if you get a chance to check them out live; do so.  Their melodies and catchy lyrics will drag you and in and their on stage energy (especially Brian smith) will hook you.",168,14
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"Ryleigh Donnovan is left to raise her younger sister after her grandmothers death.  She is confronted by, Jackson Maynard, a Death Dealer from the Kingdom of Cymmera, that was sent to procure her.

It took me a couple of chapters to get into the story.  After that, this is a book that gets more exciting as you continue to read it.

Ryleigh is a compelling heroine.  I like that she does not buy into things easily and needs to be convinced.  She is strong and intelligent.  She undergoes a lot of changes but handles it with grace.

Jackson is a worthy prince and heir to the throne of Cymmera.  I appreciate that he thinks for himself and follows his instincts, even if it could be costly to him.  He is selfless and intelligent.

Reluctant Prince is an exhilarating story packed with action and mystery.  Dani-Lyn Alexander created an intriguing world, rich with detail.  I really enjoyed this story and look forward to the next book in the series.

Guess I have to wait and get the next book and I WILL be doing so! I adored this fantasy action love story. The main characters and many of the secondary characters were so incredibly interesting and lovable. The plot was unbelievably amazing! It was so creative, ingenious, full of great action and a wonderful love story. I could go into some of the plot, but there is just SO MUCH to describe and discover, that I will leave that up to you to read and LOVE!
This was one of THE BEST books I've ever read in this genre and I Strongly suggest you go pick up this book immediately!

INCREDIBLE BOOK!

Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,This was a pretty good read.  I could see teenage girls really liking it.,14,4
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"I didn't finish. It didn't hold my interest, and I had better books to read.",15,5
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"Managed to finish the book, but to be honest, the email to review just showed up in my email and I can't even remember what the book was about except I might have quite disliked the girl in the story.",40,6
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"I received this book for an honest review.
Ryleigh and Mia are sisters they have lost everyone around them and Ryleigh is so desperately looking for a job so they can survive when an earthquake hits.
Ryleigh and Mia become separated through this and Ryleigh knows she has to find her.

Jackson is sent from Cymmera to capture Ryleigh and bring her there but when her sees her he knows there is something different so he has to decide if he is going to follow orders or not.

You are taken through a portal back and forth in this book from earth to Cymmera. you have to pay attention in some parts to know what is going on. It will not be what you expected. There is however a lot of action.",132,7
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"Stop reading these reviews and start reading this book.  The wonderful characters, unique storyline and descriptive voice make this a must-read.  I am excited for this series and cannot wait to dive into book two (hopefully soon).

I was given this book in exchange for an honest review via Netgalley.",50,8
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"*I received a complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.

This is a great book, and is good for teens and up.
I really enjoyed reading this book,  the situation of children without guardians hit close to home as I just took in foster children. The girls really take care of reach other and are surrounded by the ghosts of their past but when they meet Jackson he shows them there is more to home than a building.
Ryleigh is a natural leader and I liked reading her and Jackson's start.  I really can't wait to hear more of the story unfold.

Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"But I did not enjoy this book. Halfway through I wanted to stop reading but my need to finish any book I start made me power through it. What didn't I like?  The now-standard insta-love. Flat characters. The confusing writing. There were several times that I had to re-read a passage several times to figure out what it said. The number of times the word ""cocky"" was used. The very obviously bad bad-guy. I kept wondering how thick the main characters could be to not see what was made so obvious.",91,10
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"I read this book a while ago and absolutely loved it! I could not put it down. Such a great fantasy world and characters. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Counting down the days until October 13th, when the second book comes out!",48,11
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,Really enjoyed this novel. Original fresh concept and characters. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for an engaging unique story.,21,12
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,"For some reason it took me longer to read this book. I think part of it was because I was ok stopping which is rare.

This book was very fast-paced. The storyline kept moving and moving. I liked it though because it was different than a lot of other books that I liked.

I really liked how Ryleigh was spelt. Also there wasn't a lot of freaking out on her end about the situation. I hate the required 10-page freak out about the situation. I really appreciated the relationship that she has with her sister. I really wanted more from the relationship between Jackson and Ryleigh. There were very few moments between them and I think it would be important to see more of their relationship.

There was some world-building in this book, but nothing too confusing. I think it would have been helpful to talk more about what makes Jackson different or the people in this other realm special. This book was all about not wasting time which I liked. I hate time-wasting in this book.

There will be a sequel so I am so excited for it!

Note: I received a free copy of this book in return for an honest review!",204,13
Kindle_Store,B00NJ0VL56,The writing here needs some refinement but the story is well thought out and enjoyable.  Characters were likeable and believable.,20,14
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"I am learning to love this author's writing.  I liked the world that the author built.  I liked the love story between the MCs.  I liked that the feelings for each other was built up slowly.  The only thing I didn't care for was the many different characters the author introduced in the book.  This can get confusing for me.  I have to say that it was well do though.  I hope there is a sequel to this world, I would love to return to it.",86,0
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"The characters were so well developed and realistic. This is not a story of insta-love. Kudos has a deep shame of his attraction to Veyl; who happens to be a 20yro male prostitute. The development of their relationship was gradual and realistic. The supporting characters were great additions to the story. The sex scenes are well written and well placed in the story.
I don't want to give any spoilers away. So I will simply say that the themes of the story cover topics such as homosexuality in religious beliefs and religious culture to the consequences of shaming and prejudices. The author clearly gets her opinions across without being disrespectful to those who have different opinions. This book deserves a 5 stars rating. BTW, rape is alluded to and implied at certain times in the story. However, the author does NOT go into explicit details describing rape.",147,1
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"couldn't wait to get to my ipad to continue reading.  Imaginative, sexy I love Lia Black books",17,2
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"This book is worth of much better cover art for sure!  I resisted reading it only because of the cover and low price,  but from the first page I got sucked in completely.  Wonderful characters,  really good mix of romance,  hot sex scenes,  adventures,  suffering and even magic. Nice main characters,  although somehow a bit clich,  good amount of support characters (the mage is a real gem!) with enough story to back them up. Highly recommended!",76,3
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"Well written ,fantastic characters,  a story that developed throughout ,  fantasy, integrity humour and love at its best.  I can't get enough of Lia Black books.",26,4
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"Loved the characters, great ending.  Hope we can catch up with Vehyl & Kaidos again in the future.  And hope that one day, Guard Captain Arhn Engal finds true love.",30,5
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,It was okay. The amount of typos bothered me. Think the story could have been crafted better than what it was.,21,6
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"It is hard to review this book. It was good, the story original and peopled with very interesting characters, however it felt much too long. Possibly because at about the half-way mark the author atarted introducing new characters and it almost felt like a deviation from the original story arc. It was a good story but the pacing could use work- as if the first half needed to be more concise OR it needed to be more than one book.",80,7
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"The book started out well, but then I started to lose interest with all the angst and suffering and traumas.  When the castle section began, I really began skimming through it.  I did notice misplaced and missing commas, ""bothers"" instead of ""brothers"" (although the brothers were a bother) and ""the the"" instead of ""to the"" so if little errors like this bother you, be warned that they do exist in this book.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good.  The sex scenes were okay, but nothing special - neither added to nor detracted from the story.",97,8
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,Although the character of Kaidos was not a loveable one at first and Veyl was in his way a spoiled brat - they fell in love and made each other better - and isn't that what we're all looking for? Our better half :)?,44,9
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"Loved this story, loved the characters and loved the ending! I want more!",13,10
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,This is a long read and worth every moment! Lia Black's characters are always phenomenally complex and this story continues that trend while also providing a fantasy adventure that doesn't take a backseat to the romance. Both are front and center leaving the reader completely satisfied as a true blend of genres should.,53,11
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"I really enjoyed and loved this wonderful book it was written so lovely. I love all of the books I have read so far from this author. I have read Worthy and Where Willows Won't Grow these books are beautifully written also. I love the relationship between Veyl and Kaidos and relationship between Crow and Barlan. I love everything about this book it was very emotional I cried it was sad at times, I laugh at the comedy, I seat on the edge of the seat at the action, and couldn't wait to see what happen next with all the twists and turns. At the end of this book seemed like there could be another book I would not mind that as long as it was as good as this one. I hope if there is another book the same characters and then some in that book. I will recommend this book to everybody I know and to all my friends too. ",162,12
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"The most intriguing material I've read in m/m romance. Beautifully twisted with pain, love and enchantment. I need a part 2!",21,13
Kindle_Store,B00I6TPPYI,"If you're looking for something filled with mystical creature, adventures, love and betrayal then this is definitely your book. Well written with amazing characters.",24,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,The actual pieces were not a familiar as I had hoped.,11,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,"I work alone as a furniture maker and have grown tired of all the stuff that spews from the radio these days and decided that I needed to change things up some.  I had always loved the background music in the early Disney animated films, most of which was classical and so not knowing a thing about classical music I purchased this set of CD's.

All I can say is that I have fallen in love with classical music because of this CD set.  I find that it is both inspiring and calming and while I am certain I will never be an expert at classical music I have discovered a whole new world of beautiful sounds! Equally wonderful is the fact that it was all written and produced at a time in history when things were done without the help of a computer, the internet, cell phones or even electric lights!

Buy this!

CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,By picking the Greatest Classical Masterpieces I was hoping to hear more songs that I was familiar with but don't know the names.,23,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,"It is listed as the ""London Philharmonic  Orchestra,"" but it sounds as if a few members of that orchestra pulled out some pieces and threw them together for this CD.  It's  a ""play-it-once-and-toss-it"" type CD.",35,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,Classical music friend loves this and recommends it highly.,9,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,Excellent music to relax by and enjoy an evening.,9,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,"I cannot even play the CD at all. It says that the I need to insert a DISC. I have tried several times. No dice.
$13.00 down the drain.",29,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,Bought this as a gift for my Grandma and she's constantly raving about it and playing it. Sound quality is great!,21,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,"The music was very calming, soothing and satisfying to the mind. I recommend it to anyone. Everyone should take a listen.",21,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,"I received a CD entirely different from this one that I ordered.  It had two different titles on the CD, which turned out to have absolutely nothing on it when I tried to play it.  I did not want to take a chance on another mix-up and so I just returned it for credit and ordered something else.  Sounded like it would have been good, but I don't know.",69,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,Nice collection of music. I like getting these as they often have at least 80% of what I like and the cost is reasonable.,24,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,A disc has a defect.  It would stick and repeat the same note over and over.,16,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,We picked this as a good introduction to listenable classical masterpieces. Some of my favorites are included. Great for popping into the car CD player on trips to town with baby.,31,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,This CD has a great selection of music. It is delightful to listen to. It includes a lot of favorites.,20,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001O2SJO2,Thanks for the customer service. Really loved this CD!,9,14
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"loved these books, waiting for more )) im a nut for anything Victorian and especially San Francisco-ish.  well written and fun with the whole mesmerism/occult/fortune telling and how people used to dupe others making their living this way. good back stories as well, but doesnt overwhelm the present story in the telling. well written",54,0
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"I loved the first book in this series. Unfortunately, this one ended so quickly and didn't have the full experience of the longer books. Still, it was good.",28,1
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,fast read loved it don't think I'm reading faster just think book was written for pure enjoyment,17,2
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"I like stories with animals, especially dogs and the author's description of Dandy is so clear that I always have a visual representation before me.
The story was intriguing because the Dandy used only his dog sense without any senses enhanced by trying to make him into a human, just plain common dog sense and that was endearing enough to me.  Dogs have such keen intelligence and this was demonstrated.
It's a short story and just the thing to put a smile on your face before sleep comes.",88,3
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,This is the second short story by M. Locke that I have read.  As before I enjoyed it and plan to read more.,23,4
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,The dog sniffs out a mystery.  I hope the author writes more stories in 19th century San Francisco.  She is a good storyteller and the host primal aspect seems so real.,31,5
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"The writing was ok, setting and time period cute, but I found it irritating that this and others were a fragment of story instead of a novel and weren't clearly marked as short stories. Won't buy any more from this author, on principle.",43,6
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,It was an interesting read but the author made it as a very short read. Why? The Boston Terrier's personality fit in well with the Author's work. No doubt the Author must have pets. It would take the Author's instinct and knowledge of pets to initiate this short read. Thank you.,51,7
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"""A wonderful short story set in the turn of the century San Francisco. Has wonderful characters and plot. These characters are also in her first book of a series set during that time. I'm currently reading her book ""Maids of Misfortune"" in the series. I truly look forward to her next book.",52,8
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,Liked all of M L Locke's storie in this series.,10,9
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,With all of MLL's San Francisco books.  LOVE THAT CITY - good reads - interesting history woven into good story lines,21,10
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,Great complimentary story to the boxed set of Victorian San Francisco Stories.  Would definitely recommend if you like Victorian Mysteries.,20,11
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,What a great short story!  Dandy shows his depth and ability to care for other canines as well as humans in a most gentledogly manner!,25,12
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"Really enjoyed the one novel of Ms Locks

  I have read. This is a short story.  Don't bother.
I will stick to the novels and hope they are not this transparent.",31,13
Kindle_Store,B003HS5LY2,"I finished about the last quarter of UNEASY SPIRITS,as well as THE MISSES MOFFET MEND A MARRIAGE, and DANDY DETECTS in the same evening. I was taken back to the magic of ""just one more story"" and thoroughly enjoyed each one up to the last word.",46,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Not quite country, not quite pop but quite good.  Not sure why she's gotten so much hype compared to other artists that are her equal and remain unknown-good agent I guess.  But it's a fine album.",36,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"I have recently heard Tift Merrit on GAC and fell in love with her immediately. She is the epitome of what it means to be a singer/songwriter. Her music and lyrics can be as diverse as her voice. I have read some reviews and from what I have seen, people try to compare her to everyone else. Don't do that. Listen to her music as if it's the first time you have ever heard a sound. Judge her then, not after you have heard someone you think she should sound like. I urge you to pick up Tambourine and her first album as well, Bramble Rose. Each CD is completely and utterly different from the next and you will not be disappointed.",122,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Tift Merritt's second album TAMBOURINE was well worth the wait. I was impressed with her debut album, BRAMBLE ROSE. Unfortunately, that album never really found an audience. This album is just as good, if not better. I find the sound on this album is more evolved, and overall just pleasant from start to finish. There's a lot more uptempo material here, but still brilliant lyrical moments that are poignant and touching. The album starts off strongly with the opening track",80,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"This is the first album of Tift I've heard. I bought it because they played her song ""Good Hearted Man"" in TV and I immediately fell in love with that song. It sounds quite like the older pop song ""All I really need is just a soul man"" (or however the title was). The album was a surprise. A wonderful voice, fast rhythms, good melodies - I enjoyed it very much. I can only recommend it.",76,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"I first heard Good Hearted Man on KNBT in New Braunfels TX and thought Tift sounded a lot like Emmylou Harris (which is a compliment to be sure), although the song didn't impress me all that much.  It wasn't until I heard Write My Ticket that I realized her depth as a songwriter.  I'm a sucker for a good redemption song, and Ticket gets to me like Delbert McClinton's cover of the Otis Redding classic Dreams to Remember, and that's about as good as it gets....  I bought the CD and the rest is history.  Ms. Merritt has talent, both as a performer and songwriter,  and that's a rarity in this day and age.  She's destined  for bigger things than Americana radio, and good for her.",126,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Maybe it's that I discovered Tift by way of Bramble Rose, but I have to agree with moose_of_many_water's review above; she's a talented artist but this isn't the album that's going to get her to stardom.  It hearkens back too much to Dusty Springfield without ever giving us a reason to think she's found her own voice here.  That's not to say this album doesn't have its moments, but nothing here demands your attention the way ""Trouble Over Me"" did on her previous album.  If anything, TOO much money has been spent on this album; she would be better served to go back to more intimate productions, perhaps a la Willie Nelson's Red-Headed Stranger.",114,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"This second CD by Tift surpasses even the best of other female singer/songwriters like Carole King and Shania Twain, who deservingly had albums that were a huge commercial success. Tambourine is great from top to bottom and the last 5 songs are as good as it gets. To fully appreciate her superb songwriting, one needs to listen and read along with the lyrics a couple of times. Her songs combine sensible lyrics with excellent melodies that cover the whole spectrum of tempo. It is hard to pin her down to one genre, but this album deserved more that just the Grammy nomination that it got. I don't see how every review could not give it 5 stars!",117,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Let me start off by saying that I expected this album to be good - four stars good. I'm not a fan of country music, however, and that made me hesitant to try Tift's music. After listening to samples on Amazon I was contemptlating buying it and then I heard ""Stray Paper"" on the radio and that tipped the scales towards buy! I'm glad I did, the CD is amazing and I'm now looking to buy her debut, Bramble Rose.

If you like this, I recommend Gemma Hayes and Rachael Yamagata as well - they are simliar, but not the same and each has unique talents that make their music really great.",112,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Very good set.  Ms. Merritt grows on you like a mint julip or two.  It takes listening to more than once to convince one how good she is.  It is never fair to compare one singer to another.  However, I get a Dusty Springfield vibe here. And that is simply GREAT!  Until the classic that I know is soon to come is released, this album (CD) will do quite well thank you.",72,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Tift rocks out on this album!  I immediately loved ""Wait It Out"" and ""Late Night Pilgrim,"" but I have come to love the entire album.  This is one of those albums that I've played front to back, repeatedly, for days and weeks on end.

I caught her live at Schuba's (Chicago) - fabulous live show.  Her opening act, Nora O'Connor, was also excellent - less rock and more country, but excellent all the way around.",75,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Good stuff - blues-rock that is energetic, has horns (what song isn't better with horns!?!), and translates well into Tift's energetic live show.  A few other reviewers have mentioned the couple of Sheryl Crow knock-off songs as being too poppy and knocking this album down a notch. That is fair criticism, but Sheryl Crow also wishes she could make an album that rocks like this! ;)",66,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Again, Tift Merritt delivers some great sounds.  The combination of her sweet voice coupled with the sounds of her strong band is what makes for some of the best music in country.  It's her songs we should be hearing more often on the top 40.  But like so many other obscure talented song writers and singers, Tift is left in obscurity on CMT or GAC and their award shows.",69,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"This woke me up.  Introductory song with just the guitar and the voice and the band kickin' in after coupla bars.  (Stray Paper.) Great.  All songs (written and song by the artist) are good with one or two exceptions, mostly because of my personal taste.  Great backup band and lead and backup guitarists.  Bass and percussion, also.  Who is the piano player, no credit on the CD?  Good album.",69,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,Tift Merritt has a great voice with a fresh style.  One of the best CDs I've purchased in a long time.,21,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0002OPES2,"Tift Merritt's ""Tambourine"" is a remarkably strong set with no weak spots.  Her sound expands from the excellent ""Bramble Rose"" to include more of a soul punch.  Producer George Drakoulias has worked with Maria McKee; and ""Tambourine"" certainly has much of the appeal of the great Lone Justice lps.  The opening track ""Stray Paper"" is addictive with Mike Campbell's stinging lead guitar and Merritt's rocking vocal, ""Somewhere there's a letter that I never sent.  It used to read pretty, now it's empty as that night in the headlights with the blankets pressed.  Was it something to you baby, or was it just stray paper?""  The second track ""Wait It Out"" also rocks with a vengeance, making this a great uptempo set.  ""Still Pretending"" is a slow tune with a classic country/soul feel that encourages ""Dusty In Memphis"" comparisons.  ""Your Love Made a U-Turn"" is another soul burner with a delightful horn section that urges me to hit the repeat button.  Maria McKee joins with background vocals on ""Late Night Pilgrim.""  The CD ends on another high point with the driving toe tapper ""Shadow in the Way.""  ""Tambourine"" shows Tift Merritt pulling together expressive vocals, good songwriting and excellent musicianship for a blockbuster performance.  Wow!",204,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0025ZITT2,"One of the biggest challenges is to find source material that is recorded with the highest quality to test high end sound systems.  This is one of those great finds that every high end audio system owner needs to test and demo their system with.  Each and every selection is recorded with the highest level one can find.  It is truly rare to find such a high quality recorded source material.  I would have given the rating a 5, but found that some of the selections just didn't seem to belong on this grouping of selections.  If they would have been displaced with more appropriate selections it would have received the 5 rating for sure.

My surround system is a Bose Lifestyle V35 and pretty plain vanilla Samsung Blu-ray player.  The clarity and feeling of being in a live presentation is probably the best I've heard from my system.  The music is an eclectic mix of classical, new age, jazz and is really exciting.  I can't believe I haven't taken the time to listen to the rest of it.  Misplaced priorities on my part for sure.  This is an expensive disk but if you have a high-performance surround system it is worth the money.",110,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0025ZITT2,"I am not a huge classical music fan, and most of the material on this disc wouldn't typically appeal to me, but the stunning sound when played back on Blu-ray through a high quality stereo would make anyone take notice.  The included Hybrid SACD is very useful for listening on a CD player or SACD player, but the sound from the Blu-ray is really something else and leads to hope that I can get material that I really want to hear in the future.",84,7

The musical selections are varied and each is awesome in its own way but some are absolutely transcendent. Being able to directly compare the sound of 5.1 vs. 2 channel, SACD vs. Blu-Ray, and LPCM vs. DTS HD MA is very nice, they could have easily just put all of the tracks in blu-ray LPCM and been done with it but being able to switch back and forth a/b style and finally hear an apples to apples comparison for yourself is very useful. If you are considering this disc I wholeheartedly encourage you to get it, otherwise you are missing out on wonderful music and a chance to make your system truly sing.",128,12

In Britian, free speech survives, and people actually write and publish what they actually think. You know, like we used to two hundred years ago.",82,11

These stories reveal how the human ambassador and his wife met a Tolari province ruler and the ruler of the entire planet. The Tolari appear to be country bumpkins stuck in a life style similar to Earth's fuedal period in Europe. All is not as it seems. The ambassador's wife wields more power than her husband, the province ruler is making a power play using the humans as pawns, and the real leader of the Tolari is working hard to keep his people out of the spotlight.
Good writing and well worth the read for back-ground material. Editing was fine and most of the characters appear again in Marann.",131,10
Kindle_Store,B00AQ8HTFU,"I thoroughly enjoyed this short introduction to a new author (to me) and a new culture.  The two short stories are really the same story, told from the points of view of the human and the Tolari perspective.  Even though its the same story, different insights into the planet's culture are gained from each.  I found myself wanting to know more...lots more!  The human appearing Tolari have 'been there' where the humans are now...exploring space and meeting other races, but chose to abandon all that and now keep to their planet developing their inner abilities.  They are also hiding all that, and more, from their human visitors.  The character development was adequate for a short story but I want to learn more about the Sural and the Jorann.  Can't wait to read the longer novels.",135,11

Kindle_Store,B00AQ8HTFU,"The Humans visit Tolar for the first time.  It's almost as if they are the aliens.  The environment on Tolar appears to be just as the humans expected. Their encounter suddenly takes an unexpected turn for everyone involved near the end.

Life in Tolari Space seems to be going on like normal - for everyone except a couple of rulers and some quiet labor workers.  As the Monral thinks he is scheming behind everyone's back.  Little does he know, The Sural lurks.

What are each party's motives for wanting to encounter the other?  Maybe different than meets the eye.

The author does a fabulous job of showing how the two worlds come together in a brief but articulate manner.  Whether or not you've read a previous work, a recommend for all!  Even more excited for the next book to come out after reading this!",144,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001FQ7,I give this release 3.5 stars its their debut album and debut releases are not always the best releases but you have to start some where. I listen to it but not as often as some of their late releases. I consider it a springboard for what was down the road.,51,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001FQ7,"Love BTO, old school rock and roll from the good ole days, when rock really existed. This band was quite underrated in their day,  often criticized for their diet, shape, form, or use of chords when in fact all they delivered was hard hitting guitar riffs, catchy chords and choruses and great vicals. This LP is one of their less mainstream titles, but one of my favorites. Randy Bachman, pictured on the cover, was once one of the main forces behind the Guess Who and is inducted into the Canadian Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, both as a solo artist as well as with BTO. Superb record, give it a listen.",112,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"I purchased this album to give the new lead singer a listen.  I am a hard core Steve Perry fan and though Arnel Pineda resembles Steve, he does not capture the soul that Steve put into every single song.  Steve Perry is truly the heart and soul of Journey.  Try as they might......he will never be replaced.",57,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"Why addictive?..I've been listening only to this album and its songs since I've gotten it and nothing else. I love the ballads and the rock out tunes(on both cd) while thumping my feet to the beats...and never got bored with it. The new songs are great while the re-recorded classic hits are just as good. The DVD footage is excellent and I probably viewed it more than ten times already in its entirety. Also I have anticipated the release of this album with much excitement especially when they acquired Arnel Pineda. This guy is very talented and has a unique voice that delivers Journey's songs in their legacy sound trademark.

I know my place in appreciating good music and good musicianship of talented artist like Journey and will not waste my thoughts on comparing the Perry/Pineda debacle....I'd say get over it folks if you are. Bottomline is, I love Journey during the Perry days and I love them now just the same with much anticipation of great music to come down the road for their fans. This is a great album....go get one.",183,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"I'll tell you right up front - I adore Steve Perry and wish he'd never left the band. He'll never be replaced in our hearts. However, at some point we all have to let go of the past and move forward.

I just got my copy of Revelation and I love it. Arnel Pineda can do justice to Journey's old sound, but he's creating a new Journey sound all his own. I've always felt that the other ""replacement"" singers were trying too hard to emulate Steve Perry. That's probably why we never could accept them. I suspect they were chosen just for their voices, not because they had any magic spark that made the whole group click. I think Arnel has the magic - it's like Journey has risen from the dead.

Now I wish that Steve Perry would put out another album - the world would be a better place if he'd share his voice with us again.",159,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"My favorite part of the disc has Arnel Pineda's vocals on classic Journey hits, which I think does a fantastic job of assuring everyone that Pineda has the skill and vocal charm to measure up to anyone who came before him. In fact, he's a stronger vocalist than Perry and articulates better (Pineda's lyrics are clearer, easier to understand). I think it's cool to have one of the all-time great bands open to the idea of hiring a singer ""who ain't from around here."" Revelation is a great album, and I'm very happy I finally picked it up.",98,3

Neil Schon is probably one of the most underrated guitarist of all time...he really meshes his guitar licks with the lead singer's voice exceptionally well.  That said, there is no doubt that true Journey fans miss Steve Perry...I mean, my God, he is the greatest voice in rock history (there can not be an arguement here).  This new singer Arnel is somewhat comparable to Perry because of the soul he provides in the songs and the better than average stage presence with the other band members.  Remember, Steve Perry is a legend and no one will replace him.  So, all the 1,2,3 star reviewers do not understand that this band is on a Journey and kinda symbolic in a way that someday they all may be in wheelchairs playing with Steve Perry's returning as lead singer...ah for wishful thinking.",168,6

However, Arnel Pineda is like Pavoratti, a power tenor. Definitely Journey made the right decision to go forward with Arnel, who will bring back old fans and create new fans...and thank you to Youtube.com for providing endless hours of great clips of old journey music, zoo cover music, and new journey concerts in Chile and Las Vegas. This is a great album that will move Journey to the forefront of melodic rock music scene again!",102,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018OAP7K,"All that I can say about Journey ""Revelation"", is that Steve Perry should be honored. the vocals done by Arnel Pineda on this CD are outstanding. obviously, Arnel has studied Steve Perry. not only vocally but physically as well. he sounds and looks like him...
I bought this CD not knowing what to expect as I have bought other Journey CD's in the past during Steve's absences. this one however has amazed me. it took me back in time and if you close your eyes and listen, Steve all of the sudden appears. Excellent Job Arnel!. this man was Journey's best choice in a replacement vocalist. this CD is simply awesome...
I hope that Arnel decides to make his home a permanate one with Journey in the CD's to come.
Jonathan Cain is still the best around, the band sounds great. with ""Revelation"", they have themselves a true gem....",149,11

So all in all it's still not that bad of a cd could have been ten more on it but hey that's just me.  Would have loved to hear some of the michale graves era songs on it.",106,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009UC7NO,"I am a big, long-time Misfits fan, old stuff and new, and I thought this was a great project.

it's not like Richard Cheese, where some dorky lounge guy sings the songs all funky - instead, it's just instrumental versions of some old Misfits classics, done in some different big-band musical styles.  The styles actually change a lot, often in the same song, and there's more depth to this than you might expect at first.

punk purists mught hate it, but I think it's cheery driving music.",87,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009UC7NO,"I really did like the 50's new Misfits album, and thought that this CD could be okay.

This album is a giant disappointment.",60,5

The next song I heard from it was ""Die die my darling"", then I got shocked about the outstanding performances by Nutley Brass. The sounds, the rhythm and the arrangements are amazing. It's difficult to forget the original version, but this one plays a relaxing role when listening. Being a Misfits fan, I really recommend this disc to everyone interested not just in their music but the influences on a totally different genre.",92,7

Instead of whoring himself out on the street, or even selling crack cocaine, Jerry Only has whored out his band. Not only is the album painful to listen to, but it further destroys this bands legacy. It would appear that Mr. Only in the last decade or so has made a concerted effort to destroy the legacy of his band. This album makes a good frisbe, and little else.",84,8

If you realy want this album and you live in Los Angeles, I plan to wing my copy onto Interstate 5.

This CD is fun. They picked the best of the best Misfits tunes to re-do. I only wish American Nightmare was on here, but the rest are great. For those who say that they can't even make out which song is being re-done, I doubt that they're true fans. True fans would know. True fans can easily pick out the songs. Don't listen to the idiots who gave this 1 star. When it comes to instrumental music, I'm sure they're more comfortable listening to Kenny G.",115,10

I'm a fan of the Danzig era, I'm a fan of the Michael Graves era. I even like the current lineup with Jerry, Dez, and Robo. I'll always support the Misfits no matter what, but this album is just trash.

This album for one was not performed with the true spirit of the Misfits in mind. This my friends was made for one purpose, an easy, cheezy way to make a buck. After three songs you'll find yourself shutting it off. I actually made it to song 5 before I decided I couldn't take anymore. Their is no vocals on this album, just cheezy Casios and piped in strings. I would put this album on the same level as the worst songs on the ""Pac man Fever"" album.",158,14

Kindle_Store,B00JFBNZ6G,"For regular readers of Laramie Briscoe, you know she can weave danger, mystery, and steamy scenes together like a champ in the Heaven Hill Series. What I love about Only the Beginning is that is completely different from those books. I actually read this one right after reading the latest HH book, and it was a great way of coming down from such an emotional ride in that book.

This book is about two celebrities who meet by chance and just spark right away. I've always been fascinated by how celebrities deal with all the gossip and untruths from the press and this book is a great peek into that world. I liked that even though they were both completely different musically, that just didn't even come into play. It was their own emotional issues they had to deal with. There are some very emotional depths in this book. There is one scene where I literally cried real tears. I don't do that often but I did it here.

For those who love the Heaven Hill books, this is completely different from that, but if you're in the mood for something a bit lighter and not as dark, it's a great read!",202,2

Reaper was the perfect man to help Harmony through her own emotional demons brought on by her evil ex. Its never okay to abuse anyone and this book brought that to the forefront.  They have great secondary characters that are really involved. It addresses so many issues that many people deal with. This is a great read.,88,9

This doesn't seem to be a part of any series which is a little unusual for Ilona Andrews. But it still sounds like a fascinating world with some great characters. It seems a little lighter in tone than their Kate Daniels series. It is nice to have a lighter tale every once in a while. I wouldn't mind seeing more stories from this world.",122,6

I didn't like the bully/ thug, Chad,  that our heroine was having to date.  And the date was totally unique.  I particularly liked the pig and Alena's reaction to said pig.

Her live performances are MUCH, MUCH better than her studio recordings.

studio performances/recordings seem to restrict her voice, singing, and personality too, too much.
She is truly a phenomenal singer (the best pure, natural, and real singer out there these days) and outstanding electric and acoustic guitar player as well  as an excellent pianist.
And, boy, what a personality!!!

PLEASE, GO SEE HER 'LIVE'  EVERYBODY and HEAR THE REAL THING!!!

What a treat.  Her blues/soul sensibilities are refreshing.  I'll be be exploring the rest of her catalog,which I'm sure I'll enjoy.",84,3

One listen was all it took to realize that this was a performer I needed to follow.  I started with ""Runaway Soul"" which still moves me after almost daily listening.  Her songs inform life.  This newest CD release--Phenomenal Ruthie Foster--has a bit of a self-congratulatory and cheesy title, but the songs are not to be missed.  Celebrate her beautiful voice on the song ""I Don't Know What to Do With My Heart,""  or moan with the blues of ""Mama Said.""  Foster is firmly in touch with every genre of North American music.  She turns competently between traditional spirituals and more contemporary pop/folk tunes.  I could go on and on, but will stop just to say that you owe it to your soul to listen to this CD...and ALL of Ruthie's recordings.",152,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000M06K6Q,"I heard Ruthie Foster in an interview on NPR (National Public Radio), on ""Studio 360"". NPR has done this to me before; hooked me on a sound I'd never experienced previous. I have this CD in my cubicle at work and it is all I can do not to dance or sing out loud. I am going to have to get a copy for the car and one for the house I think. This was my first Foster experience and it is as profound as Bob Marley singing ""No Woman, No Cry"". And Maya Angelou's poem ""Phenomenal Woman"" set to song by Foster is...I don't have the words.",108,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000M06K6Q,"I bought this because I found it used for $5 in a shop and had seen the name out there but had no expectations for the music before listening. I played this in the car on the way home and was into the songs from the very start of the disc. This woman can really sing and covers a lot of ground from the church to the delta blues, all very well done. There is no overbearing instruments on this and her voice really shines through. I also liked the electric piano that is used on several of the cuts which was a very sympathetic backing to her vocals. Not sure if she played the majority of the piano or not because Ruthie and Anthony Farrell are both listed as having played the piano. It doesn't matter - this is a very good CD and I will be exploring more of Ruthie Foster in the future!",156,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000M06K6Q,"Do yourself a favor - whether it be this album or any other Ruthie Foster, get it (or several).  Her voice is raw, powerful, pure, magical.  What and when she sings is from the heart and soul - you can hear it in her voice or watch her on stage as her joy and love of music shines through on every note, sung or not.  Ruthie Foster is a gem and you will not be disappointed.  Her rendition of a Sun House tune is enough to make any blues fan (or any music fan) a fan of hers.",98,9

Thus far, it's one of the stand-outs of what I brought home with me.  I'm already looking forward to searching out and finding her new album as well.  Ruthie has a great voice and is a wonderful tallent but in my ears, what makes this album so good is the fact that she doesn't over sing the music.  There's not a lot of ""showing off"" or vocalizing for the sake of vocalizing.  She sings wonderfully throughout and is able to groove and swing with the best of them.  This is a great soul album.  Mostly laid back tunes.  I look forward to hearing more recordings by Ruthie (I'm thinking I'll track down ""The Truth"" and probably pay full price!) - Keep up the good work, girl...

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"Of course, film fans have high expectations when going to see and HEAR Indiana Jones' films.  I am not different.

Sadly, John Williams hasn't created anything truly memorable in this score.  It only comes to life when one hears the familiar retreads from the original.  Other tracks sound like ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Harry Potter,"" or ""Superman"" leftovers.  Only does the track ""The Adventures of Mutt"" possess some of the spark that was the key behind the success to the first Jones' film.

I realize that composers can ""revisit"" themselves or borrow from others, but Williams usually throws in something new in each of his film compositions.

I just don't hear it in ""Crystal Skull.""",113,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"As expected, John Williams does his usual great job on this score. I don't think this will get him an Oscar, but this will hold its' own with the best of his scores. No John Williams fan should pass this one up.",42,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"John Williams is by far the most accomplished and successful composers in Hollywood..I will stand by that till my dying day. Unfortunately, IJATKOTCS is not one of his greatest works. A beautiful nostalgic opening with ""The Raider's March"" is about as good as its gonna get with this one. Unlike the Star Wars series where each character has his/her very distinctive theme music that would literally stay in your head the rest of your life, this piece of work (though technically sound) really has nothing signature about it. It quite frankly left me bored by the end. Very different from the music of its predecessors, which did not really surprise me at all considering the film itself doesn't come close to the Original Trilogy either.
The main reason I bought this album was because the previous 3 are impossible to find today and I really wasn't too keen on missing a 4th time round. Nothing Distinctive here!",157,3

What more could you ask for, this is Indiana Jones. Even some of the newer score is fantastic. As soon as the "" Raiders March "" started I began to feel like a young child once again, carefree and innocent and thats a great feeling. Simply put, if the music makes you feel good inside then it must be doing everything right. Thanks again John Williams.",96,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"I listened intently when I saw the movie the other day for anything original that stood out like in the other 3 movies (i.e. the Marion love theme from Raiders; the slave mining theme and Indian village themes and Willie Scott love theme from Temple of Doom; the grail theme, father/son theme, etc.) but there was nothing that I heard specifically that stayed with me. I did hear a lot of familar music cues from the other movies (Marion theme and the grail theme--surprising used extensively towards the end of the movie). Just like the movie, I felt the score was rushed and Williams basically phoned this in. Of all his scores, this one was really lacking.",117,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"The soundtrack to Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull is again written in the old hollywood action adventure sound, and we again thank you for it. Indiana Jones' music hurries you thru from one threat to the next but takes the time to let it all sink in with the music taking you from one cressendo to the next. Without it, Indie would just be another 5 letter word. See the movie, but make sure you buy the soundtrack!",79,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"With arguably one of moviedoms finest anthems in ""The Raiders March"" to build off of, John Williams once again shows why he is probably the finest movie theme composers of all time.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"I was hoping to get another great Indy score, but unfortunately we just get ""another"" Indy score. Whimsical. That's all I can say about it. Most of the cues, including some of the larger action pieces just sound like Indy and the Gang are out having a rollicking good time keeping up with the commies. There's only a few cues where you actually feel like there's any kind of threat. Williams is by far my favorite composer of all time and having listened to all of his scores countless times, he tends to borrow from himself once in awhile. In this score, I hear a little Far and Away, a little Hook and something that I didn't expect. 3min 22sec into track 13 we hear a note for note cue from War of the Worlds!?!?( track ""4"" the Intersection Scene 38 sec into cue). Not sure what that means yet, I guess we'll all know May 22nd.  (After seeing the film , it means nothing. Much like the movie itself....a whole lot of nothing)",174,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"John Williams rarely strikes out, and he has definitely not in this latest composition from Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

The Indiana Jones theme is what everyone remembers.  I would rank it as one of the best motion picture themes.  The rest of the soundtrack is very good.  There is nostalgia woven throughout this soundtrack.  Marion's theme is back and is found in several of the tracks, whether it be a a few seconds or not.  Some of the Last Crusade music makes a return as well, at very appropriate times in the movie.  I think it's an indication of how well the composition is by how well you are moved by the music and this made me recall all of the fond memories of Indiana Jones moments.  There are some rather different themes at play but very much in tune with the theme of the film.

Until the other 3 soundtracks get re-released, this is your best chance to have the Indy theme.",168,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00171MNM4,"There's really two ways at looking at this.

The all too familiar Raiders March and Map Room cues are used to anchor this cd, but unfortunately there are no NEW cues to differentiate Crystal Skull from the original three movies. From one viewpoint it serves as a reminder of all the things that were good about the originals both as fun iconic films and the memorable music that accompanied each.

But as an original work, this cd fails almost across the board for me. I didn't want a nostalgia piece, I own the previous three scores - as with the new film, I wanted something updated and fresh but still part of the Indiana Jones universe and it does not succeed in that respect.

While the trademark Williams ability is here, it just seems like potential unfulfilled. A new Indy Jones movie soundtrack should have been a benchmark work, not solely a reminder of what once was great.",158,14

Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"This is a sweet historical romance and the title is very misleading.

Declan was devastated to lose his older brother Gabriel and has dedicated himself to the estate in seclusion since unexpectedly becoming the Duke of Hawksley. After 3 years he decides to accept an invitation to spend the summer with his best friend the Marquis of Ashford.

When he arrives he finds the marquis' sister Poppy in her wild garden by chance and is immediately entranced by her.
Poppy is a lively and bright and is also struck by Declan. She has three seasons behind her and has rejected all proposals. For the first time she is fascinated by a man.

There are no major intrigues. It is a gentle love story that unfolds at a summer party.  The focus is on the intense attraction and growing love between Declan and Poppy. The writing and events are lively and keep the pages turning, perhaps in a Jane Austen style but with more spice.

The other characters are interesting, even to the point of hoping for their stories in future. In fact, I see that Poppy's twin sister Piper is the subject of `Seduce me Please' and I have just ordered my copy.",203,3
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"Did an editor ever read this? Was it proofread? The writing is clich and sounds like an adolescent girl writing in her journal. I have to agree with ""incognito"" - no character development, no consideration given to any consistency of POV (it switched four times in four paragraphs), no motivation, and horrendous sentence structure. I can't comment on the progress of the plot because after reading the first 10% of the text I just quit. What a waste of $3.00.
In my old life (H.S. writing and writing for publications teacher) this author would have been roasted by her peers during her first reading to the writer's circle. Their feedback would have been ""start over"" because there would have been nothing to work on improving.",125,4
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"Thin plot, characters with no personality, and I don't think anyone bothered to proofread the manuscript; spelling and grammar errors abound throughout the book and are very distracting.",28,5
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"I hate not finishing a book... But I just couldn't.  This one, with some proper guidance and editing might have held promise, but... I could not stick around to finish it.  Please, before this author writes another book, please take time to edit it, spell check, and have someone look over the grammar, etc.  This felt like a first draft... just could not do it. it hurt too much.",69,6
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"It has been so long since I've read a good romance novel, and I was so enthralled with Ruin Me Please I was unable to put it down. The love story between Poppy and Declan has just a pure spirit and true love that the entire time you are wanting to take in more and more of their powerful love. By the end of the book I was wishing I lived in that time and made me miss chivalry and genuine love, I want my own Castle Ruin. I can not wait for more, because not only are you drawn into the main character's romance but the supporting character's have love stories intertwined in the book as well. Nicole Matthews really knows how to reach the romance part of a woman's heart, it was sensual, sensitive, caring, respectful, intoxicating all at once. In a time where Romance is dead and Divorce and heartache are the norm its refreshing to be swept away from it all, and that is exactly what Ruin Me Please did for me!",176,7
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"It had potential. And I forced myself through the book, hoping it would get better. I actually found misspellings in this and the grammar structure was horrible. Get this girl an editor that can help re-write portions of the book and maybe she'll have something!

A book with potential is still a crappy book. My advice to the author if she reads these: keep trying and find a good editor and some readers that will give you honest and sound advice.",81,8

Besides who would ever think of Poppy as a damsel in distress.

I do hope a 4th is on its way about Peyton!",73,11
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"The cover makes you think it may be an erotic novel. It's not. But I knew it wasn't. Seems an odd cover for a historical romance.

Unfortunately, this book suffered from at the very least, someone to proofread it, make sure the grammar was up to snuff. It could stand a good editor too.

The writing felt a little too much on the juvenile side and too dramatic. The hero and the heroine acted that way too.

I'm glad they allow sampling because I strongly recommend readers sample the book before purchasing.",92,12
Kindle_Store,B004YWKEKQ,"I have never given a book a one star review. That was generous for this drival. How this ever received positive reviews is boggeling. It was painful to read three chapters and not wonder at the age of the author and thinking maybe this was a grade school project. I could not even finish.  My 13 year old writes better stories and with less repeating of the same line and phrase again and again.  The reviews that rate this book good HAVE to be friends of the author and trying to boost her up, or else this was meant for grade school.",102,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"Daft Punk's Discovery gets put through the ringer by some house and hip-hop luminaries. The resulting album, Daft Club, shows a wild range --- lots of fun. The Neptunes turn ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" into a R&B track, while Basement Jaxx throw whatever sonic debris they can get their hands (from Arabic horn samples to vocal squeals) into their mix of ""Phoenix."" Boris Dlugosh, however, doesn't do much for ""Digital Love."" Both Demon and Laidback Luke deliver harder versions of ""Face To Face"" and ""Crescendolls"" respectively, but the Slum Village version of Aerodynamic minimizes the wonderful baroque chords and maximizes not-so-wonderful broke rhymes. And just in case you didn't get enough of ""One More Time,"" there's an acoustic version. Definitely a mixed bag of a remix album, but still worth checking out.",132,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"There's a reason why some songs are made available only over the Internet, and it's not because they're too good for ordinary record buyers. These guest remixes might have made for nice freebies , but they don't add up to much of an album. While the 2001 source record, Discovery, struck a balance between dance-floor mechanics and prog-disco kitsch, the remixers here opt for either/or, so Boris Dlugosch's ""Digital Love"" is humdrum house and Gonzales's ""Too Long"" is fantastic gimmickry. Only the Neptunes stand between Daft Club and utter irrelevance. They reconstitute ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" as offbeat digital soul built around a nagging synth line and Pharrell Williams's great falsetto. Not for the first time, they're easily the best thing about a good record.",125,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"Not very good. Not nearly what it could have been. There are maybe 4 good tracks on the whole cd. The rest are complete crap. It pains me to write this review because I'm a huge fan, but I haven't even had this cd for a day and I'm already tired of it.",53,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"daft punk ARE my favourite dJs of all time... they come out of nowhere and have infectious songs that you canno get out of the head... this LP is just a remix album of their 2001 classic DISCOVERY.  but it does nothing for me really....

i am feelin the 'aerodynamik' (daft punk remix)....

I LOVE THE NEPTUNES but, their remix to one of my favourite songs of all time 'harder better faster stronger' is just terrible.... they should have never touched it at all...sorry neptunes...the other remix by jess& crabbe us way better.

this album should have had more songs from their album... they are missing 'superheros', 'queis-vous', and 'voyager' some of the best tracks on the DISCOVERY album.....

this album has the same song just remix... aerodynamik has 3 remixes (2 too many), they should have left 'something about us' ALONE....

i love daft punk but please come with new material so i could forgive you for this dreadful piece...",161,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"DAFT CLUB IS ANOTHER GREAT ALBUM FROM DAFT PUNK, THE TECHNO FRENCHMEN. THE THEME FROM INTERSTELLA 5555 IS ON HERE AND IS TRULY AN EXCELLENT SONG. AERODYNAMIC IS ALMOST BETTER THAN ROBOT ROCK BUT NOT QUITE. THE NEPTUNES AND BASEMENT JAXX MIXES OF HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER AND PHOENIX REALLY ADD TO THE UNIQUE FLAVOR OF THE ALBUM'S TECHNO. THE ONLY SONG I HATE ON HERE IS NUMBER TEN, A RAP REMIX OF A GOOD SONG THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE CRAP.",82,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"I got this CD recently and have listened to it several times. It is a nice remix to a bunch of Daft Punk's great songs. It's smooth and slowed down with some more vocals in places. Very nice cd to listen to. It's not hard techno, but it's a good cd. I definitely recommend it!",55,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"Simply, nothing I can complain about. Some great sounds were released in this album, and of course, a must have for Daft Punk fans alike.
 Starting off with the Ouverture is a great idea, and is totally the Daft sound we have all come to know and love in their first release of Homework so many years ago now, and as we all still know their ever adapting sounds are also quite aparent in this release. Mostly remixes of thier 2001 released album ""Discovery"" this VeryDisco CD, covers every sound you want to hear from Funk to House back to Funk. Lyrics carry us through the whole way. The Punk's own re-creations in AeroDynamite, and Crescendolls are a great sample of their early work.
Some songs on this album should not have been toyed with, like Phoenix I will admit, (my personal fav from Homework) but aside from that, sit back and enjoy the sounds that other artists have loved enough to remix, and I loved enough to keep me comming back for more.",174,8

Homework is a great album Fresh is my favorite song, but all of the stuff is my favorite their beats are hypnotyzingly phenominal. television Rules The Nation is my alltime favorite, I Love Daft Punk. if you have iTunes download a song or if you have limewire just listen to them and you'll be crazed by their awesome rythms",89,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"I could practically count the tracks I liked on this album on one hand.  Although I do agree with some of the reviewers here, ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"" was one of the better tracks because I like the Neptunes.  I also like the ""Aerodynamic"" remix by Slum Village.  My favorite track of all time?  ""Aerodynamite""!

The tracks that actually made me mad was ""Crescendolls"", the slow version of ""Too Long"", and the slow version of ""One More Time"".  I liked them on Discovery, and to hear it on this album made me sick to my stomach.  I think the saying, ""Often imitated, never duplicated"" goes with these tracks, though they didn't try to ""duplicate."" And ""Something About Us""?  They didn't even have to touch it.  It was fine the way it was.  They had some okay remixes, but it lost steam as it went on.",145,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000TI3Z0,"Daft Club is a remix album by Daft Punk. Some of the songs were already placed on their Discovery album, for example, Aerodynamics, which is a song that they have been remixed and rearranged with its order. The overall style of the album lines in parallel with those of their previous efforts. Besides the songs on the album appear to be a bit more crunchy than any other Daft Punk albums.",71,13

Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"Yes, I liked the story a lot. In fact I didn't want it to end.

'Blackbird', by Anna Cary, is written in second-person narrative, a style I enjoy reading. I found the story to be exciting, fast and heart pumping with an abundance of twists, turns and surprises that should satisfy the craving of just about any adventure junkie. Who couldn't find interesting the situation a young adult female finds herself in: semi conscious, lying on subway tracks with a train approaching, and not remembering how she got there or, even, who she is.

So, why not five stars? Because a lot, of the story, was left unexplained, and, it ended abruptly. I suspect much will be divulged in the next installment, though. And, I truly don't like it when purchasing a sequel is necessary for fulfillment.",137,0

Without spoiling the plot it seems to be about a late teenage female without a memory of where she came from, how came to be on Los Angeles subway rails, or even her name.  Throughout the book she trying to find answers while running around metro LA having barely credible adventures.

Mildly interesting but but nothing is resolved.  I found this most unacceptable.

Mostly I found it immature.  I remember writing stuff like this in middle school.  My teachers always criticized it as being too undefined and unresolved.",99,3

There's the 2nd person viewpoint.  That's distracting.  The ending is unsatisfying.  Of course, this is bound to be a trilogy, but even so, the ending could have been better.

Okay, those indeed are legitimate gripes.  Yet, I liked the main ""you"" character.  She has me liking her even though she doesn't know herself.  The book is fast paced enough and I didn't really want to put it down.

""This book was intriguing from the start. It's told in second person, which is unusual, and a little weird. It was different. Not bad, but definitely different.

It was interesting to read a book where the main character has no idea who she is. And we have no idea who she is. It was strange. The book itself wasn't really scary, but when she starts to figure stuff out -- if you actually pause to think about it -- it's freaking terrifying. Overall, this wasn't my favorite book, and I didn't absolutely love it, but I did enjoy it.""",115,6

Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"In 1924, Richard Connell won the O. Henry Memorial Prize for the short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"". This story was the forerunner of many stories, books and movies (such as John Woo's 1993 film Hard Target, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme). Blackbird is an extended, modern, urban, YA version of it. Since The Most Dangerous Game has been required reading for decades in many schools, there's no need to repeat the plot here. The book is written in a mix of points of view and a mix of fonts to help the reader focus. I found it acceptable, but it lacks the punch of the short story, the horror of John Saul's The Manhattan Hunt Club (an adult version), and the skill of Thomas Perry's Dead Aim (yet another version). In short, there's a familiarity for the reader and the book is designed for a niche audience. It may work for that audience, but may not appeal to any other, such as adults like myself who enjoy YA novels but are accustomed to stronger fare.",175,8

The plot starts right on the first page and then doesn't ever let up.  It has some amazing characters, and descriptions that made me feel like I was right in the middle of the action.  It is also very age appropriate, which is great! Although the main character is a girl, this has enough action and adventure that I think it would also be appealing to teenage boys as well. Overall, this one is a great read!",134,10
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"I almost DNFed this book. Almost. Maybe the fact that it isn't too long helped keep that from happening. I had a really hard time getting into the book in the beginning. I felt like everything was random and I hated feeling so into the dark. But, things started picking up and I really ended up liking it.

Probably the most important thing to not about Blackbird is that its written in second person. That might be really hard to get past while reading. I know I had some trouble with it. Once I got more used to it, I really think it adds the story and helped me understand more about how the main character felt. The only thing that bothered me is that the point of view changes a few times in the book, which made it a bit confusing.

The book is full of action, which I love. Its definitely exciting, and once the story picked up it didn't take long to read. The ending left me really wanting to know more about all the mysteries surrounding the main character and how everyone is connected to each other.",191,11
Kindle_Store,B00HLIVYEK,"Anna Carey's ""Blackbird"" is a mishmash of different stories: amnesia, on the run, people want to kill person, trying not to get distracted by the second person POV...

I mean, I liked it in the sense that it was a fast paced, easy read. There were a few turns although the turns weren't surprising. I'm not a big fan of second person POV though. I think I've read one book recently where it was used well but I found it a bit distracting here. To be fair though, the main character (nameless girl) doesn't know who she is. Also, not every chapter is in that PoV.

Anyway, I'm already looking at picking up the second book in the series so it has piqued my curiosity to see where it goes.",130,12

I ended up not finishing this one after 50%.  I have heard that it does get better, but tense aside the story wasn't working for me either.  It just came off as too much and I don't think enough plot was thrown in.",102,13

The author did a great job in choosing to make this a novella instead of a short story.  As it is, the author was able to give enough information to create a fascinating world and give us some insight into the culture.  As with all great science fiction, everything isn't spelled out for you, and even when the world unfolds, the reader will still be left wanting to spend some more time learning about the world and what comes next for the people who are studying and learning about the world.

There are definitely enough glimpses into other parts of this world that make me think the author might be writing some more novellas or even, I hope, a novel.

Review:

""Looking Through Lace"" by Ruth Nestvold was a wonderful fascinating short Sci-Fi read. This author did a wonderfuljob with the main character, Toni Donato who was female xenolinguist.. her assignment was with the first contact teamon the alien planet 'Christmas to analyze the secret women's language' ... studying the Mejan culture. The women spoke a different language that the men were not allowed to learn. Why and how did this happen?

However, obstacles are put in place for Toni to do her job...the chief linguist(Dr. Repnik) began to disrupt her work so she was going to have to do something. How did she accomplish this task?.... Well, you will have to read ""Looking Through Lace"" to find out.

""Looking Through Lace"" wad a well written and worthwhile read. If you a a science fiction lover... this is really a novel for you. The title is perfect for this read and I liked the book cover.",176,10
Kindle_Store,B004P5NSKA,"This is an unusual book by Ruth Nestvold. The topic concerns a woman who studies languages and who is working on a distant planet to learn the languages spoken there.

The alien world in '""Looking Through Lace"" 'is fascinating - although the inhabitants are descended from humans, they have a unique history and culture. The women speak an entirely different language among themselves that the men are not allowed to learn, and Toni is determined to figure out how and why that happened. However, she has a jealous senior colleague and the affections of an attractive native (who just happens to be in a group marriage) to contend with.

I enjoyed reading a science-fiction story by Nestvold; all the other work I've read by her has been fantasy. She keeps up the excellent worldbuilding and characters. I found the revelations concerning the history of the world very interesting. The antagonist xenolinguist seemed like a bit of a caricature, but the interesting alien world more than made up for it.",178,14

Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,"Penguins: Butlers of the Animal World by Lynn Simone is a penguin book like no other. My kids loved the facts and quality tidbits of information on each and every page.

Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,This book is a compilation of interesting facts about penguins and essentially their life story.

Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,"Penguins are unique in many ways, they battle temperatures from extreme cold in Antarctica to very hot African rocks. They are dedicated parents and you just have to love them. The book is interesting and put together with care, the pictures are very good and all this makes for enjoyable reading. Recommended for bird lovers.",55,5
Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,Lynn Simone presents a wonderful book about the life of penguins. I never knew there were so many different types of penguins and this book describes them all. I found it very interesting to read and easy to follow with excellent images as well. I was especially intrigued with the chapters about distribution and migration and the breeding and babies. I recommend reading this book. You will enjoy it immensely!,70,6
Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,I read this book and loved.  It is amazing to know that there are about 20 species of Penguins living today out of which 3 are considered to be endangered.  This is a great book for adults and kids who would like to know more about the life of Penguins,50,7
Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,"These adorable flightless birds come to live in Lynn Somine's ""Penguins: Butlers of the Animal World.""  Simone gives an overview of penguin life and traits, and then offers interesting facts about different varieties of penguins, including banded penguins and the great penguins.  If your little one loved the ""Happy Feet"" movie, this book is a great way to teach them about real-life penguins.",63,8
Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,"This is a wonderful little book describing the life of penguins. We learned so many things that we didn't know about Penguins and where and how they live! Did you know that penguins swallow their fish whole? Or that they can drink saltwater and spit the salt back out of their NOSE? Or that some species of penguins live or travel up the west coast of South America all the way north to the equator? Penguins are such interesting creatures, I think you and your kids will like this book!",90,9

Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,"I bought this book to help out one of my young nephews because he was doing a school project on penguins. It was perfect! This book is full of interesting information on penguins and is presented in a way that's easy for kids to understand.

It has info on types of penguins, as well as their characteristics, behavior, where they live, how they move, what and how they eat - everything you could ever want to know!

If your kids love penguins or animals in general, then I highly recommend this book!",92,11
Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,"My family is fortunate to live near a large colony of fairy penguins, and have been several times to see them come ashore after a busy day out at sea. It was wonderful to see them featured in this book.

Lynn Simone's Penguins book also talks about many other breeds of penguins, some I had not heard of. She also talks about penguins anatomy and how they live. A wonderful introduction for any child.",74,12
Kindle_Store,B00GNJHSG6,"Lynn Simone does a good job of offering just enough solid information to be educational without being boring. Balance that with a strong selection of wonderful photographs and you've got a book that kids will spend time with an learn from. I picked up some knowledge and thoroughly enjoyed the photographs. My kids enjoyed the book, too ... and it inspired one of them to go to the Internet to find out more about the Rockhopper Penguin. Education in an entertaining form, What more could you ask from a kids book?",91,13

CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"I own all of Teddy Thompsons prior CD's, and loved his only Brisbane show at The Troubador (an unbelievably classy act for the privileged few in such an intimate venue).

""Bella"" is immediately welcoming and enjoyable, infused with Teddy's trademark vocal and lyrical stylings. The album continues to improve with each listen, and that's due to the strength of the musicality as well as the quality of production.

Teddy deserves big time success and broad acclaim. As a solo live entertainer he's a grand master, but I'd also love to see him with a full band performing this material.",99,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,I think Teddy Thompson can do much better with better musical arrangements. In I 'm your man (songs Cohen and very good arrangements) he was fabulous! Great voice but the arrangements on this CD are boring.,36,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"Teddy Thompson delivers a solid albums' worth of wonderful songs.  He has a knack for writing lyrics that ring in your emotional memory as a sentiment you have felt before.  His voice is just as solid as his first album, which I bought because my daughter brought it home from her job at Barnes & Noble.  The music department workers got to bid for the promotional CD's provided to the store.  I have purchased every CD he has put out since, even the country-heavy ""Up Front & Down Low"".  He has a beautiful voice and I want to hear more and more; I hope he keeps giving me what I want for many years to come.",116,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,A great voice and singing style plus terrific guitar player.  Have all of his recordings and have seen him in person.  Funny and self-deprecating.,24,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,This is the best Teddy Thompson disc I have heard. A little country in places but fun and full of heart.,21,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"This CD is an instant ""love every minute of it"". It's not the kind that has to grow on you, listen to several times before it shines, you know. This is wonderful right off the bat.",36,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"Teddy Thompson's yearning, aching new CD, ""Bella"" is a superb showcase for his rich, angst-filled vocals. Not since his friend Rufus Wainwright's ""Want"" CD, has an artist's romantic suffering produced such a glorious display of gut-level heartache.

The heartfelt longing in the songs is perfectly captured in Thompson's versatile singing.  His vocals on this CD show his enormous versatilty and range. In one song, he seamlessly switches from falsetto to a lower octive in the span of a few seconds. Teddy alternately channels the sadness of Roy Orbison and Richard Thompson, the immediacy of Jackson Browne, and the sly, witty irony of an upbeat Crowded House. The arrangements are denser and lusher than his previous outings, similar to Wainwright's ""Want"", but the songs are more tightly focused and crafted. The only misstep here is the opener, ""Looking For a Girl"". The lyrics of the song are too pedestrian when compared with the rest of the CD.

That Teddy Thompson is not a huge star defies logic. He is one of the finest singer/songwriters of his generation. His voice is a thing of beauty, with few contemporary rivals. Teddy wears his heart on his sleeve, and for that, we should all be grateful.",202,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"Beautiful.  Simply beautiful.  His vocals, lyrics, arrangements - all spectacular.  This music runs the gamut from haunting, to yearning, to just good fun.  This may be his best CD to date!",31,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"First off his voice is spectacular! Jaw dropping! Could listen to it all day. Secondly the lyrics are beautiful (He named this album correctly) and the music is over all great.  There is only one song I would change.  Tell Me What You Want is a duet and doesn't need to be. Teddy sounds great, song's great, but HER voice doesn't live up to his and it ruins the song for me.
(Andrea Bocelli throws mismatched duets onto his albums sometimes too(like Romanza) and it drives me crazy).
That aside, this cd is a must own!  It is gently country without being in your face country.(which can be fun too if you are in the mood for it,not dissing on country). The highlights are the Keith Urbanish Looking For That Girl, an instant classic, and the haunting Take Care Of Yourself, stunning!!!  Don't miss out on this album, it is a must own!!!  At the very least, go through the mp3 list and download a few. Start with Take Care of Yourself and Looking For That Girl.",177,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"I'm a fairly new Teddy Thompson fan. First heard him in a Nick Drake tribute concert. Lovely singing voice and this album showcases that voice at it's best so far. Although ""Separate Ways"" and the eponymous first album, ""Teddy Thompson"" are better(Brink of Love and Separate Ways are beautiful songs that have no equal on this new album);his voice on Bella has never sounded lovelier. Is he trying to channel Roy Orbison on ""Take Care of Yourself""? Teddy's albums are consistently well written and performed with terrific back up vocals (Rufus and Martha Wainwright) and musicians (Richard Thompson). This is a good solid album. Maybe a little more produced and commercial than priors, but worth listening to and purchasing.",119,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,Saw him opening for Rufus Wainwright. He was amazing. Immediately bought the album and have it on repeat ever since :).,21,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"A chip off the old block, Teddy carries on the tradition of his parents, British folk-rock legends Richard and Linda Thompson.  His vocals evoke the open-throated soul of Boz Scaggs, the heart-on-the-sleeve romance of Richard Hawley, and the ache of Roy Orbison.  Excellent production by David Kahne wraps Bella beautifully.  A thumping rhythm section joins with cosmopolitan instrumental touches such as subtle strings, a clacking xylophone, and reverb-drenched, low-string guitar figures, to build a layered listen, all good.  If only Thompson had the lyric skills of his dad, Bella would be an all-round winner.  But most of the songs overstate the obvious, devoid of metaphor, simile, or poetry, for example, ""Home:""  ""Home is where you go when you need to know wherever you roam, you can always go home.""  Huh?  If you don't listen too closely, Bella is one guilty pleasure after another.",143,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,"I confess it:  I'm a BIG Teddy Thompson fan. I just think he's a major talent that is not getting nearly enough attention.  But I find this new album is only at a ""good"" level.  His earlier works, like ""Separate Ways"" and ""A Piece of What you Need,"" are so extraordinary that the comparison bar is very very high for this guy.  He's a brilliant performer, however, and any of his stuff is enjoyable.  Great voice, great songs, beautiful arrangements.",80,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,This is Teddy Thompson's strongest collection of tunes.  It has the lyrics we've come to expect.  He's in great voice.  And the arrangements seem to have some bite.  Check it out.,31,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B003VWR1WO,I think Teddy Thompson is extraordinarily talented.  But some of the overwrought production values in the collection took away from his amazing voice and intelligent lyrics.,26,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B002NACYAO,"The CD is a wonderful expression of praise to our Great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Especially the song "" I want to thank you"". Which is the epitome of true thankfulness  for what Christ did in saving a sinner like me. Lisa Page truly expresses that in this song.",50,1

The anointed voice of Ms. Page-Brooks is so unique, and the lyrics are powerful and inspiring, as they clearly communicate the gospel of Jesus Christ; something absent in much of today's Christian music. Though, 'I Want to Say Thank you' is a dynamic song, most of the songs on the CD are equally as great.",73,14

Dean has suffered so much and he needs Niki to make him whole again and Niki needs Deans strength and love to make her complete. I highly recommend this book and all the other books in this series.  This author is amazing and I know you will love her books as much as I do.  Be sure to pick up a copy for yourself, you will be glad that you did.",84,1
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,This was one fantastic book. It is full of suspense and intrigue and sex scenes.  This was hard to put down.,21,2
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,"After reading Bad Kitty, I was excited to find out more about Niki and her extraordinary abilities. Niki is tough as nails and almost cruel in her opinion of Dean and the prospect of being a mom. Granted, Nikis behavior is understandable as her past and her family are revealed. While Niki is all hard edges, Dean gives her balance.

Dean had a rough go of it in this book. He found his mate and when he wakes the next day, shes gone. His estranged brother, Bhric, shows up weeks later to tell him that not only has Deans mate been staying at Bhircs bar; shes also been kidnappedand is pregnant.

The story is a wild, fast-paced ride filled with rescues, revelations, fights and lots of mated shifter sex. The sex scenes are graphically detailed and had me blushing a number of times. I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the next installment.

***I received an ebook copy from the publisher via Net Galley in exchange for an honest review. All conclusions reached are my own***",178,3

How can I leave him when I can't keep my hands off him.  He not going to just let me go.  This is a hot hybrid shifter story that I enjoyed.  I think you will also.,66,5
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,Great continuation of the series! Eliza Gayle writes paranormal romance very well.  I look forward to her new books in all of her series!,24,6
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,Twists and turns that kept it interesting with some real emotional turmoil. I enjoyed the well written steamy bits but it was even better that it had an actual plot,30,7

Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,"Be Were by Eliza Gayle is the first book I have read by this author. It is not the first in the series but I was able to follow the story line with no real problem so it is a stand-alone. However, it is also a predictable paranormal shifter story. I have no problem with that either but do wish there had been more story to go with the steamy scenes in this fated mate tale. Perhaps if the book had been longer the story could have been developed even more. Still an intriguing read. 3.5 stars

Copy provided by NetGalley for an honest review.",105,10
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,This book had some very interesting new characters hope more comes from them. The story has taken on a hold new twists with how these shifters where maybe made. So on to the next book and how the story will end. So enjoy the read ! !,47,11
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,I wasn't sure if I was going to like this series and darned if I'm not very happy I decided to go for it!! Awesome! Can't wait for the next one.,31,12
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,"4 out of 5 stars!! Finding your mate is like finding a needle in a haystack, so why is Niki trying to run away from hers? This intriguing fast-paced novel brings back all your favorite characters from ""Bad Kitty,"" gets you involved with these hot new characters, while setting up the series for a bunch more twists and turns that will be interesting to see where it'll go!

Dean and Niki believe that they are complete opposites, which is why Niki runs away from him in the first place, yet they are more alike, then they know. Hot tempered. Feisty. And once they open their hearts and lives to each other, nothing can tear them apart not even Niki. =0)

I cannot wait to see where this series goes, especially since they Kitty & Rafe seem to stay in the immediate background and I really like them!

I recommend this novel and series to anyone who like reading about alpha males in paranormal romances!!

Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews
-- read more of this review and two teasers on my blog: frommetoyouvideophoto.blogspot.com --",187,13
Kindle_Store,B00FYZYEXK,"This one starts off steamy! Two people, shifters, are hit with the need to be together and they give into that urge. But afterward Dean says that four letter word, MATE, and she runs. She doesn't know that she carries a small bit of him with her, besides the mate bite he put on her.

That baby is a hot commodity since Niki's a rare white cougar and they aren't supposed to be able to breed. I was left wanting to know more about the white cougars.

While this is #5 in the Southern Shifter's Series, one is quickly caught up in the world that Ms. Gayle has created. I haven't read the first four, but that didn't hinder my reading enjoyment. Not all of the questions are answered at the end of this one, but the reader isn't left with a cliffie, either.

To my surprise, I actually enjoyed the plot more than the steamy scenes. It certainly made me want to read more about these shifters. If you are a shifter fan, this series should appeal. I know I want more!

Kindle_Store,B0067L897M,I got a free sample of this book and liked it so much that I bought the e-book immediately because I had to know what happened after the first few chapters. Mr. Soucy has created memorable characters and placed them in a unique storyline which moves quickly and keeps your interest until the end.  I definitely think this series could be turned into a fantastic movie. Keep up the good work,71,1
Kindle_Store,B0067L897M,This book even starts out good. Keeps you going. I couldn't get enough sleep last night for wanting to keep reading. Loved it.,23,2
Kindle_Store,B0067L897M,"I read the sample before buying, and was upset with myself for doing so, since I was in the middle of another two books. So I bought it and LOVED IT! Soucy writes in the first person like he is there in the body of Jeremy Davis, and he takes the reader there with him.

The passion he has for his story is displayed with well-written text. Soucy has a craft of first person like nobody's business! Usually, in first person writing, the writer gets too trapped into the body of the narrator. Soucy avoided that trap.

Jeremy Davis was loveable, but human, but not exactly human anymore. He has a knack for finding trouble, like most young boys. And just when you think he has it all figured out, he goes out and finds MORE trouble. Yes, I did scream at my Kindle a few times and tell it to RUN!! I felt empathy all the way through the book and was upset that it ended where it ended (how rude!) Because I wanted more...!!!",176,3

Kindle_Store,B0067L897M,This book was incredible!! It was intense and scary. Scary that this all started for such a young child. I think that he is so powerful because he is so good at heart. His love for life makes his powers stronger. He truly doesn't want to have to kill but knows he will have to to save the ones he loves. He looses so many and so much for a child but stays strong.

After a full listen I was really wishing I could return this album chocked full of medicore tracks.  With the exception of ""B.O.B"", ""So Fresh, So Clean"", ""Ms. Jackson"", ""Humble Mumble"", and the interlude ""Drinkin Again"", most of the album falls short of going anywhere beat wise.

I got frustrated with Lucia when she couldn't see the man in front of her was interested in her. She kept fighting her feelings for Jackson. And Jackson, would get me mad with the games he was playing with Lucia, even though he said he wasn't playing games with her.

Lucia is having trouble finding a man. She is getting a bit older and her parents would like to see her settled down. She goes on the hunt for love. She tries just about everything and with her friends pushing her on, she tries online dating. Chat Love is the one she signs up for. Lucia goes on one dating disaster after another.

She meets someone almost perfect from work; but he still keeps dating other women. She isn't sure who is the one. She finally ends up realizing her love was there in front of her the whole time.

Now, fast forward to her trip home from the restaurant in a taxi; Lucia is on the phone with the friend who set her up on the blind date tonight and she turns to see her date Richard in the car next to her as they are both stopped at a red light.  Imagine her disgust when he not only picks a winner, he eats it!!  After all, she just had kissy-face with him.  Never fear, Lucia meets her match, but the journey is the tale.

I'm from New York and met my now husband in NYC! On the bright side, it is an easy read, I like Lucia and her group of friends, and I loved the complex character Jackson. On the dark side, the book was very repetitive. When Lucia finally started to get what she claimed she wanted, she began second guessing herself and pushing them away. That was frustrating. One of my biggest complaints about the book was the magnitude of alcohol mentioned. It is mentioned in every scene and was a huge turn off for me. I think Lucia needs an intervention. I would never recommend this book to my teenage daughter!",142,12

She created a world that was so much fun taking a peek into.  Lucia has an interesting circle of friends, all searching for love...or maybe sometimes just a good time.  She is lonely and wants to believe in true love so her friends talk her into an online dating service called Chat Love.  The dating adventures that she has are really funny.  All the while searching for love, she is trying to ignore the great chemistry she has with her womanizing co-worker as well as her family's attempts to set her up with ""a good Italian boy"".

As a web dev who has worked as IT/help desk, I found her even more relatable.  Particularly her style of internet sleuthing.

I read the book straight through on a lazy Sunday.  Having survived the dot.com boom, I found the characters and storyline intelligent, believable and engaging. The plot clipped along nicely.

I also see a hint of the beginning of a Team Alex/Team Slim rivalry. :)

Hacking her way into places she had no business getting into this case was slowly building into a national threat.

I hate it when reviewers give the entire plot away so I will say no more about that.  It was a credible plot of greed and espionage. It could have used a bit more editing so the chapter started at the beginning of the page.  Character and scenic descriptions were on the edge of too much but passable. I expected a bit more of a romantic interest with one person or another but that didn't happen and the end got a little confusing but maybe that's just me. A good book.

This book grabbed me immediately and didn't let go until I had finished reading it in its entirety.  It was very well written--and avoided all sorts of police/mystery clichs.  The author had a way of helping the reader to get involved in the characters without giving trite and lengthy characterizations.  It seemed that the author had some first-hand knowledge about computer technology and this enhanced the story's plot.  The reading was fun, yet exciting.

Another of my favorites are, When it Rains, Anything at all and Shy that Way.  I was so excited to hear she was coming out with a new album called Twentythree.

  I bought the album and the feeling which I had the first time I listened to her was gone.  As a fan, I was disappointed.  Her voice didn't change, it was the songs.  I wasn't thrilled to listen to them over and over again.  I felt there wasn't the same kind of passion behind her voice now as so evident before.

It is however, definitely a huge mistake to have this cd copy protected... new(er) artists should know better than to disallow POTENTIAL fans from listening to their music!

This cd is truly great though. Very unique style and voice if you don't mind it sounding a bit pop (and I do mean only a bit). If you enjoy the likes of  Fiona Apple or Rachael Yamagata then you'd probably love Tristan as well. Buy the CD, worth every penny if you plan on spending it!",107,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009X759W,"The day I heard Tristan as a live guest on the Bob Rivers radio show, I went out and got myself a copy of her CD.  She performed marvelously, live on the radio, her voice was unusual and full of passion for her music.  So, firstly... I got the CD home and discovered, of course, that it was copy protected AND that to back up my CD would require allowing the CD to install regulating software on my computer.  Who in their right mind would allow an unknown program to be installed onto their computer - a machine that most likely contains valuable data and trusted programs?  Not me.  Secondly, after listening to the CD on a old CD player, I discovered that the songs on the CD weren't remotely up to the standard I'd heard her perform live on the radio.  Gone was the passion and the unique quality of her voice, replaced by songs that pretty much all sound like everything else out there on mainstream radio.  I hope that her future CDs live up to the hopes I had for this one.  I won't purchase them, however, if they contain the sort of ""protection"" that makes this one practically useless.",203,7

Her lyrics are intelligent, her melodies are beautiful, her guitar playing is very good both melodically and rhythmically and her expressive voice and phrasing is unique.  This girl is her generation's Bonnie Raitt or Joni Mitchel and I love her music.  Check her out on G Love's Lemonade cd, song called Beautiful.  Tristan, don't know you, but, I think you're awesome and extremely talented.  Congratulations on all your success.  Can't wait for your next cd.  Love the dvd on 23.

My personal favorites are Shy that way and Electric which I consider to be 2 of the stronger tracks on this CD. Tristan Prettyman is definately worth a listen!",63,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009X759W,"Fans of TP come from the likes of some similar artist, Jack Johnson, Donavon Frankenreiter and G-Love among some others. She has her own laid back surfer style and brings something much need to alot of the music being put out in this day and age. Don't be fooled by the attractive girl on the cd cover either, let her lyrics and her smooth finger picking speak for themselves. ""23"" has a good mix of mellow songs and groovy up-beat tunes that make this an amazing record to listen on a long drive or on a short trip to the beach. The only thing that could have been better about this release was a longer play time. The cd ends just under 40 minutes and your left wanting more..which isn't a band thing at all. If you get the chance, check this girl out live. She puts on an amazing show and is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Not enough good can be said about this. Check it out!",172,11

It's hard to believe that her previous studio album, Dilate, was so intensely emotional yet here she's so bright and happy.

On one level, she is easy to identify with.  However, on another  she completely awes and blows your mind. DiFranco has been around for  awhile, LPC is a taste of a more musically mature Ani, though still  lyrically impressive and wonderfully enjoyable.",84,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000058MY,"I own Not A Pretty Girl, Dilate, and this album by Ani Difranco. While I thouroughly enjoy the first two--Little Plastic Castle never pulled me in at all really. I've given it numerous listens and still I don't think it remotely compares to the other two albums I own by her. The only song that sticks out to me is ""Gravel"" and even that song I am having trouble recollecting exactly in my mind. I suggest the other two if you are a starting Ani fan. I must admit I'm surprised by the overwhelming popularity of this one.",98,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000058MY,"This is definitely one of Ani's best cds, which had the hard job of following up Dilate and Living in Clip, definitely two of her very best. Little Plastic Castle is up to the task, however. The first song, Little Plastic Castle, starts out slow but suddenly jumps into faster music with trumpets. Fuel is one of the best songs on the cd, with spoken word over musical background. Gravel is a very good song, but the live version from Living in Clip is better. As Is is my favorite song, a beautiful ballad. 2 Little Girls is a great song with wonderful lyrics. Deep Dish is a very fast, dancable song featuring ""Pontifications"" and ""Incantations,"" according to its credits. Loom is one of the best songs, it has a great sound. Pixie is also one of the bests, with it's amazing chorus. Swan Dive is ok, but not particularly noteworthy. Glass House is another great song, also with a particularly good chorus. I've never really like Independence Day that much. Pulse is an astounding 14 minutes and 16 seconds, but it's well worth the time it takes to listen to it. It's almost hypnotizing. Overall, a cd definitely worth buying.",201,6

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000058MY,"3 1/2

DiFranco strives at creating consistent, edgy folk punk with a feminist slant, and although she has a distinguished career amongst her peers, has rarely created an album that engages full-throttle throughout. Little Plastic Castles is known as one of her stronger discs, and it does showcase her many talented styles of various acoustic alchemy with little effort. But only about half of the album's material truly stands the test of time, usually centering around DiFranco's excellent up-tempo numbers. Her talent for mesmerizing strum patterns in these songs simply outshines mid-tempo predictability coupled with (at times) strained vocals/lyrics or poetry-styled readings.",102,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000058MY,"This album was my introduction to Ani and a very good one because I'm a big fan now. Some of her best songs are on this album. ""Swan Dive"" is excellent as well as ""Independence Day.""  ""Feul"" is one of her smartest songs, a groovy rap with lyrics  reminiscent of Dylan. The arrangements are great and you get to listen to a  couple of different bass players and drummers (I like Sara and Andy the  best). If you are a fan, get this album. If not, this could be a good place  to start (it was for me).",98,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000058MY,"Being a long time fan of the famous angsty Ani, up till now I've appreciated everything she's done. Not many fans consider this her best, but it hit me. And it hit me pretty hard. Her amazing strums on the guitar and breezy vocals haunts you in the best way possible. What makes her music even tastier is her honest and sometimes humorous lyrics. Yeah, yeah, we know Ani is sad, bitter, yet sweet, however Little Plastic Castle is adorable. I flinch when I say that, afraid Ani will swear at me for calling her adorable. I don't worry though, because I'm one of those true fans that will support her a thousand or more years from now. Thanks again Ani.",121,10

No Control is pretty much straightforward hardcore, on most of their songs at least.  On Process, every song has the amazing vocals and melodies.  Greg Graffin is a genius.  He always has something to write about; the human way and how it works.  He has an amazingly huge vocabulary.  I learned more from their songs than in school.",91,0

I've heard all of their albums and Suffer is the only one that comes close (or maybe ATG.)I Want to Conquer the World is probably their best song.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000001INX,"For the most part, I really do not like Bad Religion. Albums such as ""The Gray Race"", ""No Substance"", and even ""Empire Strikes First"" are complete bores. However, their early stuff was great. Albums like ""Suffer, this, and ""Against the Grain"" were great. In my opinion, this is the peak of their career.

  One reason I like this band (in their early days) is because they managed to take skatepunk, a very crappy genre, and make it enjoyable to even the hardest of hardcore punkers. Skattepunk hadn't been this great since JFA, and wouldn't be this great again until AFI's ""Answer That and Stay Fashionable"" album.

  The music and lyrics are great too. The lyrics are political, but not aggressive, they are intelligent. Brett is a great guitarist, and the rhythm section is tight, and punchy. And Greg, unlike most punk rock vocalists, does not scream or yell, he actually sings. Simply put, this band was very innovative, and influenced many bands (most of them were horrible, though).

  If you are a fan of skatepunk, pick this up. If you like real punk, get this. Overall, this cd is a great buy for people who like punk rock in any form. Buy or die!!!",204,7

According to a previous post ""Television"" (which is from the album ""Stranger Than Fiction""), is ""a complete rip-off of Sum 41"". For those of you who do not know, ""Stranger Than Fiction"" was released in '94, while Sum 41 was formed in '96. Just thought I'd point that out.

His recipes for Pot Beans and Refried Beans are probably true to Mexican cooking while some of his other recipes are variants. Of course this is my personal opinion, and I grew up eating Sonoran-style Mexican food which is different than what is typically found in California.

Some of the recipes you will find in his cookbook include:

Juan's Refried Beans (Refritos)
Mary Ann's Avocado Relish (Salsa)
San Diego's Fish Tacos

You will find plenty of color photos illustrating the various recipes and an interactive table of contents.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"Although I love Audra McDonald's voice and interpretation and acting ability, I'm disappointed by the choice of songs.  From reading the other customer reviews, it seems that I'm out of step.  I want to hear songs with melody; something you can hum afterwards.  These songs are more like musical prose than musical poetry.  Like the boring part between the arias, if you're not an opera lover.  The singing is of course wonderful, but I wish she'd go back to the kind of music she had on Happy Songs.",88,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,I can't say that I really like this CD.  I bought it based on hearing one song.  The rest were all kind of the same.,25,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"Not my favorite album of hers, but the Laura Nyro songs alone are worth the price.",16,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"Oh my, she's done it again.  Audra McDonald's new album is every bit as breathtaking as her previous three, but made all the more exciting with some surprising song choices.  John Mayer's ""My Stupid Mouth"" is probably the oddest choice for inclusion, but Ms. McDonald's rendering is the highpoint of the album.  As always, her extraordinary acting skills shine through, particularly on ""God Give Me Strength"" and the tongue-in-cheek ""I Wanna Get Married"".  The only weak point: Adam Guettel's ""Dividing Day""; it's a beautiful song and is, of course, beautifully sung, but it creaks along in this incarnation.  Regardless, Audra McDonald has bestowed upon the world another stellar album to enjoy, marvel at, and keep us satiated until her next go-around.",121,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"The spiralling clarity of her voice needs strings - but nonetheless for fans this is a splendid album of mostly little known songs.  Her first two CDs are more accessible and dramatic, but for those of us starved for the perfect soprano singing songs of great range and depth, this is an addition to collections to be brought out on cold nights when you stoke the fireplace and make popcorn and seek warmth from within.",75,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"I was intrigued when I heard Audra McDonald tell her audience during a recent performance in San Francisco that her next CD would be a compilation of popular music written by new and established singer/songwriters.  Having followed her career for ten years now, and seen her perform with the San Francisco Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, as well as her usual 5-piece combo, ""Build a Bridge"" is a refreshing departure from the music for which Ms. McDonald is renowned.  Overall, the selections on ""Build a Bridge"" are well-chosen songs that showcase her beautiful instrument around lovely arrangements in a new way.  Impressively, Ms. McDonald's voice is warmer and richer than on any  previous recording (and I've listened to nearly every one countless times).  Have you ever walked the length of a bridge and been surprised and happy when you reached the end?  Listening to this CD is like that.",149,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"Audra McDonald is a great singer and a wonderful person. She can make an art product out of worthless song that otherwise can only be used for ""empty driving"". Her personal investment makes diamonds out of coal. But there is inevitable question of whether it is worth it. Is it worth it to invest in dust? Not to say that all songs on this album where bad until Ms. McDonald inflated them with her passion, but how much higher she flies when she is helped by the genius of Nellie McKay. It looks like Ms. McDonald is afraid to apply herself to the works worthy of her genius. Let's hope that she will find the road in her next album.",120,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"audra is not only a multiple tony award winner and phenomenal actress, she is a beautiful recording artist.  You will not be disappointed by this CD.  It is so beautiful...the best track is ""my stupid mouth""...get this CD!!",38,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"I'm confused by Amazon's review - I think this is a beautiful album.  It features Audra's trademark surprising song choices and nuanced interpretations.  I think the reviewer who said that Audra's interpretation of the Nellie McKay song was completely straightforward should have another listen.  One of Audra's biggest gifts (aside from her incredible set of pipes) is her dramatic ability, her ability to communicate such a wide range of colors and emotions.

Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for Audra to record the wonderful set of ""7 Deadly Sins"" songs she sang at Zankel Hall a couple of years ago.  Please, Audra, please!!!",101,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION OF SONGS FOR MS. MCDONALD.  I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE NEIL YOUNG SONG ""MY HEART"" BUT IT'S THE TWO SONGS WRITTEN BY THE LATE LAURA NYRO THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TO THINK THAT NOT SINCE THE FIFTH DIMENSION'S MARILYN MCCOO HAS THERE BEEN A VOICE SO PERFECTLY SUITED FOR NYRO SONGS.  PERHAPS A COLLECTION OF NYRO SONGS WILL COME OUR WAY LATER IN HER CAREER.",69,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"This album hasn't quite gotten the critical praise that I think it deserves. McDonald's daring reach into new territory, breaking out of her more traditional sounds, is refreshing. I love the American songbook, but BUILD A BRIDGE reveals that the tradition of great songwriting did not end in 1960 and is not restricted to the Broadway stage. These songs are all nuanced, intelligent, and haunting. Her voice is superb and brings each song to a new level, helping us appreciate lyrics as simple as ""Bein' Green"" and as dramatic as ""Tom Cat Goodbye"" in a whole new way. We miss some of the vocal gymnastics of previous albums, but the texture of McDonald's voice actually sounds richer and deeper when attached to a simple melody and paired-down orchestrations. For all that's been said about BUILD A BRIDGE compared to her other albums, it just might be her most beautiful.",149,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"Some of these cuts are really bizzare and not very melodic. I would like to believe that only Audra could pull this off, but I am finding myself skipping many of them because they simply don't appeal to me. Too bad. Plus, I have seen her perform in person, and I just saw a New Year's performance of some of her work Live at Lincoln Center, and I was so turned off by her personal opinions I turned it off. I am not interested in hearing the personal opines of entertainers; that is not what I am paying for. I am paying to be entertained. Get off the soapbox Audra. I will not be purchasing anything else by this ""artist.""",120,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"Once again, Audra McDonald proves that she's the best musical theatre singer since Streisand. While many fans might quibble with her selections (mostly covers of rock and pop songs), her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none.",38,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"There are certain singers, Ms. McDonald being one of them, that I've often said are so good that I'd pay to listen to them sing a phone book.  Up until now, that claim wasn't ever tested.  Let's back up a bit first.  I love Ms. McDonald's voice.  I first heard her sing an ing&eacute;nue role in Lincoln Center.  It was Carousel.  She stole the show in my and a lot people's eyes.  Ever since then, I've been mesmerized by her voice.  I still am.  But this album is a mess.  It's well produced and arranged, but the song choice is bizarre.  No I don't want to hear anyone, even Ms. McDonald, do a cover of the novelty song Bein' Green.  Ms. McDonald's voice is a gift made for the musical theater.  It is not made to sing the wonderful songs of Laura Nyro or Randy Newman.  Lord knows other great singers have made clunkers of albums like this and returned to fine form with the next effort.  I imagine the same thing will happen here.",175,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000HDR92C,"I love this cd, it is a joy devine to listen to, yes we can sit back and critique it for what it is not. But in this case, I'd rather spend my time  enjoying what is offered here. It is a very moving experience for me to hear Mrs. Mcdonald singing any thing,any time ,any place, I was fortunate enought to see her in Ann Arbor, Michigan a couple years ago. It was very satisfying to say the least. And once again I  have no complaints with her choice of material for this disc. I believe that we must learn to except that artist must be allowed to do what moves them. This is what makes the hard work that goes into every performance (when such is the case) worth while. With a voice like hers I would not care if she sang theme songs for sitcoms. I just love to hear her sing.

Kiki and Tweety are girsl who are in the game and can hold there own. Tariq is somebody who keep to himself and who also have a thing for KiKi and also hate Ian. Who will Kiki choose? Tariq or Ian?

Kindle_Store,B005G4WUSU,"This is definitely not your average gangster book. The characters are great, the storyline is great, I don't know yet if I like the Bailey brothers or what, kinda a love/hate relationship. One thing is clear, THEY DON'T PLAY. Those two are pretty gruesome, but I still couldn't put the book down.

I am looking forward to reading the next installment",61,1
Kindle_Store,B005G4WUSU,"I had all but given up on reading any books that the main characters were black. Too much sex, raunchy writing, cursing, bad plot lines, transparent characters, mistakes and SMUT. Thin Ice has changed my mind. This book was EXTREMELY well written, believable people, great story lines, suspense, drama and I was unable to put it down! I felt every tear, winced at the well written but not over the top violence, laughed out loud at the attitudes the females gave, and shed tears! The only bad thing I have to say is that I'm royally upset I didn't have the next book! I have recently finished 2 & 3, and can I say she has kept up the pace!!Kr THANK YOU for that wonderful experience!  If you don't have this book, GET IT NOW.",135,2
Kindle_Store,B005G4WUSU,"OMG!! Can you say drama,sex,murder etc.... This is an amazing story of the streets.  Ian ""Ice"" Bailey runs the streets and eliminates anyone in the way.  Kiki is a female version of himself and the two do some damage!!  Kiki has many men wanting to love her but Tariq is her heart but circumstances do not allow them to be together.

Many other characters have great story lines such as Jaleesa, Ryan, Landon (who kind of fades away, wondering if he returns later on?)

Kindle_Store,B005G4WUSU,"I've had book one of the Thin Ice series for quite some time now. After discovering that I was 12 books behind in the series, I was a little hesitant to begin. After hearing how good it was from various friends and family members, I decided to give it a go. I haven't looked back since. Thin Ice is not just a series; it's an urban soap opera. In book one, we meet Ian ""Ice"" Bailey. Ice is feared. His name rings in the streets and he is not to be played with. Unfortunately for Kiki and her best friend, Tweety, they haven't gotten the message.
 ""Thin Ice part 1"" was a rollercoaster of a ride. The characters were in depth. The storyline flowed well and kept me on the edge of my seat. Ice is one of those characters you love to hate and hate to love all at the same time. There were some minor editing issues but nothing that took away from the book. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the rest of this amazing series! 5 stars!",181,8

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"This CD is awesome.  I heard my buddy playing ""Lost Boys"" alot and it would get stuck in my head and i was like man i really like that song so he showed me a few other songs on there and i borrowed the CD from him and i've been playing it constantly. I don't particularly care for Bam Margera much, but yeah, he picks great stuff.  I love tracks 3, 6, 17, 18 and 20.  I've been listening to it all the time lately and I've been checking out those bands.  I'm actually not really familiar with any of the bands on it cause i usually listen to more new punk stuff and I'm starting to kinda get into metal now.  (p.s. Those riffs on 18 and 20 are freakin awesome.)",132,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"I must admit, when I first bought this cd, I bought it for the support of Bam Margera. I figured it would add to my collection of Bam stuff. However, I did not expect it to become one of my favorite cds of all time. I have never heard of some of these bands before, but all the songs were awesome. I do not have one single complaint. If you are a fan of Bam Margera, skateboarding, and Viva La Bam, then you will most likely love this cd. I was definately not disappointed: I have listened to it pretty much non stop since I got it. It was the best money I've spent on a cd in a while. I must admit, it was a job well done by Bam Margera!",132,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,I think the Viva La Bands cd is alright. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be but the choices are still pretty great! And the dvd is definitely a bonus!!,33,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,this is one of the best cds i have bought in a long time. i hope bam puts together another cd like this one. every song on this cd is good. i would highly recommend buying this.,37,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"I am a big fan of Bam Margera, so when I saw this album, I was pretty happy about it. It has some good tracks on it. Some of my favorites include ""Soul On Fire"" by Him, ""Cold Black Days"" by Atrocity, ""King of Rock n'Roll"" by Daniel Lioneye, and ""Familiar Realm"" by CKY. The album has a good collection of rock favorites, but I have to admit that I was excepting more. Half of these bands I'd never even heard of before. But I guess that's good because if you hear a new band, it can turn you on to a new style of music. But anyway, if you want a nice collection of rock favorites, than you want Viva La Bands.",123,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"i love this album because Bam chose 21 different bands that are all kick ass!  and whats cool is that i have never heard of most of these bands but they definitely got my attention now.  my favorite tracks are familiar realm by CKY, i don't care as long as you sing by the Beatsteaks, and lost boys by the 69 eyes rocks!",63,7

It's a great idea how Bam brought so many bands together that aren't well known in the States and gave them some very good publicitiy because all of these bands deserve the attention- they're all so talented!  I highly recomend this album to anyone interested in true rock music...you will not be dissapointed!!,73,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"Ok, I have never heard of some of the bands on this CD, but I have to admit that I love this CD.  It is the only one in my CD player anymore.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"I'm pretty eclectic when it comes to music so when I heard this CD at a friend's house, I was stoked that it was such a good compilation CD. Bam Margera put his favorite bands on one CD and many of the artists are from overseas so being able to hear their music is fab! I love HIM, CKY, Clutch, and of course, the Sounds. Everyone should go out and buy VIVA LA BANDS because it's a rad CD!",79,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0009PLMMQ,"It is great that Bam uses his stardom to bring awesome bands to the spotlight here in the US! If you have not heard about The 69 Eyes from Finland, here is your chance to hear them and see their video for ""Lost Boys"". This is a great collection of some talented artists.

I used to get a lot of advice from my grandmother, before she passed away. It always came with a story and occasionally in a few choice words that I wish I had written down.

This book is a labor of love, advice written to children and grandchildren and shared tenderly with a much larger audience. As I don't have the book of advice that my grandmother would have left, I suspect she would have approved of the nuggets of wisdom left to me by Dolores. Great insight in her writing.

I'd heard some of her song's on the radio, more popular ones like ""Insensitive"" and ""Could I be your girl"", and purchased this CD hoping to find more like it. Smartest thing I have done in a while. You can put this CD on and let it play, you don't have to skip over songs. It is superb from beginning to end. Her lyrics are so intimate that you will feel like you wrote them, or that she wrote them for you. My favorites are ""Demolition Love"", ""Gasoline"", and ""Good Mother"", but like I said the whole thing is amazing. Buy it and see for yourself.",120,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002G3A,"Wow! I am speachless... this CD is one  of pure perfection. Jann Arden is a master of words; a lyrical genius. Her songs talk to the heart and come from the soul, and her voice is angelic beyond description.  ""Insensitive"" is not a song to listen to when you're in a great  mood; I am near tears every time I listen to it. ""Good Mother"" is  a beautiful and up beat song about a woman who has everything, but has  ""never wanted something so bad."" The only singer out there that  can compete with the lyrical value is Melissa Etheridge. Buy this CD... you  will NOT regret it.",108,4

Is is a great song, but I couldn't have guessed that the rest of the CD would be as good.  From start to finish, Jann weaves passion into every lyric and her melodies are gorgeous.  Others have compared her to many of the ""alterna-femme-lilith cult"" types, but I believe she deserves a place all to herself.  The duet with Jackson Browne, ""Unloved,"" is a beautiful word of hope to all who've had loss and made mistakes, and ""Good Mother,"" with its anthmic chorus is a song that praises the works of a wonderful perosn as well as proclaims that there is always something to be thakful for.  I wish Jann had more success in the US-- we're definitely missing out!!!  Buy this disc and you won't be disappointed!!",153,7

Not only does she sing and play guitar, but she wrote every song on here. Her lyrics are almost poetic and very deep. She is a rare talent and deserves to be heard. This is one album that really grows on you with repeated listenings. The first time I heard it I wasn't that sure about it, as some songs do need repeated hearings. But, that is the way with all good music, it gets inside you after a while and you end up loving it. This is a must-have...highly recommended!

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002G3A,"Jann Arden' ""Living Under June"" just may be the closest thing to musical perfection that can be achieved here on this earthly world.
Boy, I'd hate to think that I'd have to actually go to the ""great beyond"" to find out for sure. Thank Goodness I don't have to, I can stay right here and listen to her terrific music right here on earth.
She (Ms. Arden) grabs your attention from the very first song, ""Can I Be Your Girl"", and she then proceeds to take you for a total musical experience that you soon won't forget.
Her melodic haunting vocal phrasing, and the deep heartfelt emotional delivery on her other songs like ""Demolition Love"", ""Insensitive"", ""Gasoline"", and ""Wonderdrug"" left me speechless, but clearly humming her songs for days.
The pure musical enjoyment that I got from this album (""Living Under June"") has lead me to purchase several more of Ms. Arden' CD's.
For the record, she has had me ""in her grasp"" as a big fan ever since I first heard her music seven years ago, and I know that you'll enjoy this CD just as much as I did. Be prepared to be a loyal Jann Arden devotee.",200,9

Jann Arden says one of her inspirations growing up was Karen Carpenter.  Mine, too.  Arden's voice isn't as velvety or as purely perfect as Carpenter's.  Certainly the arrangements aren't as lush.  But Arden's voice is more immediate. She seems more worldly, been-there-done-that, though never too jaded to sing her signature ""Good Mother.""  If you enjoy Karen Carpenter, Joni Mitchell, Dar Williams, Sara Bareilles, Anna Nalick, Beth Orton, et al, you will probably enjoy Jann Arden.",102,10

a secret, shhhh, I was ""June"" that Jann lived under, her apt in Canada was under mine - long ago - she changed it to June - cause Sally didn't rhyme with anything. so happy to have been an inspiration for that song!

the song - ""Insensitive"" is about the only one heard on US radio - which is a shame - lots of others are so good. but, in Canada, they get to hear a lot more of Jann. Luckily, my dear Norman and I live right by the border, so we get Canadian radio stations here.

we love the songs ""Could I be Your Girl?"", ""Demolition Love"", ""Looking for it"", ""Good Mother"", ""I Would Die for You.""

love it love it love it! play it over and over...

sultry, smooth, meaningful, bluesy, nice melody, nice rhythm, soft & sensual, sexy, lovely!

She still sounds decent enough - almost like Leann Rimes - and the single 'Dreams' is as good a song, if not better, than 'I Believe.' 'Don't Cry Out Loud' was the one big diappointment on this CD. You got caught up in the torchy emotion and yearning on the stage, but this rendition just falls flat. The production quality on the last two tracks seems cut-rate and hurried as well.

I also think that it's good for a singer to show that they can emote and sing beautifully without 'belting' all the time. ""I Believe"" and ""Dreams"" are just flawless.

I BELIEVE:
Well, it's better than Fantasia. I was waiting for this one. I just wish Tamyra would record this. Afterall, it is her song. However I do understand why Diana got the shorter version than the Idol winner. Only because Fantasia earned it. If Diana had won, Fantasia would have had to be stuck singing ""DREAMS.""

I mean, let Diana sing it HER way.  Other than that, I think that Diana's first efforts are very respectable.  ""Dreams"" is a surprisingly good track, and ""I Believe"" is good as well.

Did I mention that Katelyn not Catriona is betrothed to someone else? 13th century Scotland and their problems, right? Nonetheless, yearning and passion erupted between them only like Samantha Holt could describe it!
You all know my love for Samantha Holts Scottish romances novels. I discovered her with To Steal a Highlanders Heart. To Dream a Highlander was no different, the pace was a little slower than the other book and the ending let me a little unsatisfied (Spoiler Alert). But it was a charming story of two people coming together against all odds. My pom-poms are still in the air! One question: Why are the women so prone to scheme in your novel? LOL Scottish lasses I tell ye!

Though this book can be considered a stand alone, I would suggest reading To Steal a Highlander's Heart (Highland Fae Chronicles)first as there were some elements I think would have added to this story.
The cover of this was nice and I think it fit the story nicely. I loved how the story was something different. Finn and Cat's chemistry is great and I really loved their love story. It wasn't just a simple A+B=C romance. I think it overall was a nice read for me, but the ending felt rushed and I'm not sure the story line quite lived up to it's potential.

Finn is gruff and  charming and tough and everything you could want in a hero. the story twists and turns as we wait to find out if Catriona will be forced into a marriage to save Bute or if she can marry the man she loves.

""Who the Hell Cares"" clearly stands as the best track. Incredible lurching rhythm, crunching guitar. This song shreds and the message is right on (""Who the hell cares/Where the ... you come from?"").  Even Snoop delivers with a smooth rap. The other songs on this album are surprizingly well made (""Hypocritical,"" ""New Skin,"" ""Metamorphosis""). I don't know if you'd call ""Get Naked"" a song, but it sure is crazy - and very dirty. ""Proposition ...You"" is more like an old school hip-hop trip and an engaging rant against pigalettos. I even like the techno exercises at the end of the album by Scott Kirkland. If you can't vibe to this then you must not like kickin' hip hop metal.",166,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000038IDT,"This CD is actually not quite like the other rap rock albums currently out in that it encompasses the best of not just those two genres (whose lines are already blurred) but actually THREE different genres. This album  comprises the best of hip-hop, i.e. L'il Kim, Snoop Dogg, and Kid Rock; the  best of rock, i.e. Limp Bizkit and Kid rock; and also the best of techno,  i.e. The Crystal Method. In addition to the other artists, The Crystal  Method collaborates on two of the albums tracks, ""Spun"" and  ""Narcotic."" That's why I gave it that that extra 5th star. Kid  Rock nor Limp Bizkit has done anything this innovative. This album has a  little bit of everything to soothe just about everyone's musical tastes. It  also satisfies those of us who like different artist from different genres.  It's about time music became as diverse and united as life has become.",151,7

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000038IDT,"Before Tommy Lee jumped on the post grunge sensitive rock bandwagon of today with ""Never A Dull Moment"", he released this album of his new ""band"" after he quit Motley Crue in 1999 when rap-metal/nu-metal was the ""happenin' thang"" (or something among those lines).  Methods of Mayhem consists of Lee playing a variety of instruments and attempting to rap (hearing him talk like a thug in interviews ticks me off so bad, he couls talk like a normal person any other time, now he's just trying to cash in on whatever fad is in, and that really gets to me considering this is the guy who made me want to drum) along with numerous guest spots from Lil' Kim, Kid Rock, Fred Durst, and anyone else whose spotlight has since dimmed.  The songs are repetitive, dull, boring, and honestly stupid and don't offer any kind of substance or showcase any of the talent that we all know Lee really possesses.  All in all, Methods of Mayhem is undoubtadly one of the worst albums I have ever had the displeasure of hearing, and this just goes to show you that no matter what may be ""in"" at the time, you shouldn't quit your day job.",204,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000038IDT,"I'll be straight with you, if you're expecting Motley Crue music, you're wrong.  This is like Kid Rock, except with more uses of the turntable.  This is where in my mind, the album fails the most.  Honestly, who would prefer electrified noise over a good guitar solo?  As far as lyrics go,  there's some originality New Skin and Metamorphosis, but most of the words  take on a lame idea that Tommy Lee is a gangster.  Another failure is the  reliance on other rap artists to appear on songs that have nothing to do  with what these artists have to say, as in New Skin.  Sex is also a  downside, (seriously, a grown 35 year old should be a bit more mature than  talking about getting naked.) But all in all, this is a good album worth a  listen to and comes through in certain circles.  If you're a hardcore Crue  fan though, you may want to stay away from this Mayhem.",161,14

All of their songs are fantastic, from the belt it out anthem ""Cuando"" to the bittersweet ""Sonrisa"" and the always fresh ""The Rain (Where Do I Begin)"". Needless to say I highly recommend this CD. To say that they rock is an understatement, they also groove, jazz and chill all with a smooth latin flavor.

I am so pleased with this CD because now I can play them wherever I go and listen to them everywhere, instead of only hearing them when I go see them perform!
Their sound is a blend of ""Sade,"" trance, electronica, a bit of hip-hop, I'd say a hint of reggae with lots of latin flavor. This is definitely an album to invest in.... you'll like all their songs.",115,9

It's good music to put on while I'm writing or working on projects at work - it's not overpowering music with heavy beats, etc but some tracks have the power to really uplift my mood and re-energize me.

My favorite tracks are: THE RAIN - Carol C's voice is hauntingly beautiful and I love the beat of the music in this song; MY SOL -gorgeous instrumental; DOLEMITE - catchy, fun track, makes me want to get up dance everytime I hear it & CUANDO.

These books are absolutely wonderful. The heroine, Priscilla is spunky, spirited, and completely what you'd expect a 12 year old super girl to be. The message of 'girl power' in these books is one thing that I really loved. This is a series that every young girl should read from ages 9 and up. While I was reading I'd give my own daughter an idea of what the books were about and now she's dying to get her hands on them. I feel that Sybil Nelson has definitely found her niche in the writing world and these books are destined to become huge! I can't wait for more in the series!

The story is one that catches you in its grasp and doesn't let go, if you read only one middle-grade series this year you must make it ""Priscilla the Great""! Be sure to check out the website for Priscilla as well at: [...]

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"This set is truly one of those rare deals that is hard to pass up.  Fischer recorded these symphonies for Nimbus over the course of 14 years.  The results are excellent, all digital recordings made in the hall where Haydn was in residence for a large portion of his life.  Brilliant has secured the rights to these recordings, and now offers them in a handsomely packaged box.  Each CD is in a sturdy envelope, and the liner notes are informative.

I own ""period"" performances of several of these symphonies from Trevor Pinnock and The English Concert, and Fischer's intepretations are worthy contenders in my opinion.  Fischer uses modern instruments combined with a period style of playing which is a very appealing combination.  I've enjoyed every disc in this 33CD collection.  Amazon's ""new and used"" partners frequently offer the entire set for under $100... at that price, you truly cannot afford to be without this set.",155,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"Listening to this album (morning and evening commutes over the last several months) has been one of the great musical experiences of my life. The music itself has been unfailingly interesting, moving, delightful -- even the neglected early and middle symphonies.  And the playing:  beautifully balanced and in tune, sometimes breath-takingly brilliant (where did Fischer find those horn players?), and often touching.  The unobtrusive shaping and molding of the individual lines and the ideal tempos (nothing driven or hasty, but everything flowing and unsentimental) make this a model of selfless music-making.
Since this collection is often available at very low prices, there's no reason to pass it over!",108,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"The playing of the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra is clean, articulate and totally professional. In short, one could not ask for a better orchestra to undertake this massive project. Adam Fischer's primary strength is his always-excellent choice of tempi. Unfortunately, he too often opts for a generic reading, missing many opportunities to ""turn"" a more beautiful and elegant phrase.  Also, there are many passages - always in forte - which are poorly balanced (this could certainly be the fault of the producer or even the recording venue, but surely Mr. Fischer approved the final edits?).  Overall, this is an impressive collection which deserves to be heard by everyone who loves the music of Josef Haydn.

Excellent recordings and performances in general.

several other recordings of these, I don't mind so much.

All of the early and middle works are recorded excellently",59,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"Anyone who associates classical music with forbidding profundity and lurking snobbishness should drop their needles (or switch their ipods) onto a Haydn symphony, and unconsciously begin to tap their feet and nod their heads to the experimental glee and unpretentious freshness of this music.  Adam Fischer's heroic complete recording has endless glories, and he avoids both the tip-toeing ""authenticity"" of many period instrument conductors and the humorless, bland beauty of the modern approach.  Instead, we get unfettered, joyous music-making which captures the spirit of Haydn.  Fischer's folksy, ragtag 18th century big band is full of personality: witty string soloists, wild oboes, a groovy timpanist, a bumptious brass section.  If you're new to Haydn, you can still feel safe buying this (though, like other reviewers, I recommend looking for better bargains than Amazon's price); I can't think of many human beings for which Haydn's music wouldn't be appealing once they get to know it.",153,4

Dennis Prager says Bach taught him how to pray and Haydn how to laugh. While I can't vouch for that, I've enjoyed hundreds of hours of Haydn, my favorite composer. One can't go wrong.

When my local orchestra, the New Hamphsire Music Fesitval, finally played a Hayden symphony after nine years of my attending, it was a blessed relief. But I had to say that, pace the Woody Allen movie Bullets over Broadway, I was prepared to kill if they had screwed it up.

I take my Haydn very seriously. So should you, too.

Enjoy all 104 symphonies. You'd be crazy not to.",140,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"All the other reviewers are right about this set.

So go get it!",53,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00006GA50,"These symphonies were originally released by Nimbus and in their present incarnation are an absolute steal at the price that Brilliant is charging.

For the most part I prefer many of the interpretations of Adam Fischer over those of Antal Dorati.  It is not just the modernity of the recordings but I feel that this conductor has gotten the spirit of Haydn into his blood - and that of his most excellent orchestra - better than Dorati and many, many others.

Run, don't walk, to purchase this bargain set of some 30 odd discs and you will not be disappointed.

The sound is very rich and colorful, and the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra displays a central European sound (lustrous strings, tasty oboes, etc.) while providing all the drama, flair, incisiveness of the best performances of Haydn's symphonies. There's plenty of bite and energy in the fast movements -- but still genteel and much lovelier than most of the the period-instrument groups and far superior in performance and sonics over the tired old Dorati set. I purchased Fischer's complete Haydn symphonies for quite a bit more when they were avaiable on a Nimbus import (now defunct) last year, and for [this money] this bountiful traversal of Haydn's delightful symphonies is now a steal. Highly recommended!",120,14
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,Really enjoyed the book looking forward to series 2. All 6 books were really great. It's not your average vampire book,21,0
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"Sorry, too many ""flashbulbs"" of realization about all the unexplained mystery moments in the four prior books, too many characters crashing to earth or into lava or whatever and then rising unhurt in the next chapter, too many bad guesses about who the bad guy really is-- from a heroine who was supposed to have been a trained police officer no less. The first four of the five books were intriguing, not this one and not a bad batting average after all.

Kiera's done for now and I'm done for good.",91,1
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"An amazing series that I couldn't put down. Get ready because I promise this is not what you were expecting! Drama, mystery, romance it has it all. Get ready to spend a little though because there is a lot of book in the series but your hooked with book 1 series 1 and can't stop!",55,2
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"What can I say, another Amazing Book in the Kiera Hudson series. This one made me laugh, made me cry & had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I think I chewed down every last one of my nails by the time I was done LMAO I am proud to say my suspicions about Elias Munn were dead on (although the reveal had me in tears, Im not ashamed to admit it!!) I would recommend this book to anyone who will listin to me, but  would suggest reading the series from the beginning. It is well worth your time. But be prepared, Mr. O'Rourke has a way of totally sucking you in to his stories and evoking a wide range of emotions is the span of the story & you WILL lose track of time =D I am very much looking foward to the next Kiera Hudson series. This Author has landed firmly on my Favs list & I don't see that ever changing. Im  totally ok with that!!",173,3
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"Well, kind of getting a little tired of Kiera loosing her Sherlock Holmes vision when it comes to the biggest climaxes of the series.. she is starting to loose it for me.  Yes, I read and liked the book, but I felt the last couple books found Kiera loosing some of what made her special in the first place.  Still.. yet a cliffhanger ending..... AGAIN!  I did buy the next book, but I stopped after that one.  I can only tolerate so much, and cliffhanger endings just annoy me.  A solid ""IT'S OK"" 3 star for me.",97,4

I think this well may be the best series I have ever read and Tim O'Rourke my favorite author. You definitely must start with book one and read them all. You won't be disappointed. For once the ending was not rushed or fizzle out. All of the characters were fleshed out and really interesting. They changed and matured. The heroine was never whiny, immature or mindlessly rushed into danger. There were laughs and heartache, romance, betrayal, twists, turns, surprises and not-stop action. I don't know what to do while waiting for the next book.",105,5
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"While reading I can't believe the author did what he did. Especially towards the end. That is when I wanted to take the book and destroy it because he didn't even give me a heads up of what was going to happen. When they stood in front of the elders and then Keira turned to Seth and when she turned was when I was caught off guard....no! I screamed as if it was going to change. I read and re-read it to make sure I was reading it right because I couldn't believe they killed him. So I am going to be honest I wanted to curl up and cry and not read the rest. (That is when you know it is a good book  when the book takes an emotional toll on you whether it is happy, sad, angry, love or hate.) But I put my big girl panties on pushed through the heartache and read on.  Which of course I am glad I did. Have fun enjoying all of the emotional rollercoaster that this book will give.",179,6
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,Love the series keeps me wanting more  the author makes u care about the characters that's what keeps me coming back,21,7
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"This series was ok and quite overpriced. Each ""book"" is really a long chapter, frequently without proper endings. The characters are one dimensional and are always YELLING. Made my head hurt! They do really stupid things in order to fill the ""book"". Overall, I wouldn't have bought these books again and definitely won't buy any of his other series, not at $3 a chapter. The writing just isn't good enough to justify that cost.",74,8
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"I must say I just brought the five books to this series just last week and have finished vampire hollows right now, I did enjoy the thrill chase romance and mystery of wanting to know who was the ""big bad man"" but I have to say I am a little dissapointed in knowing this was not the end and now the four of them are dead flesh. I am at an aww of what this author will come up with next. I will most likely read it just because I am curious to know what happens in the sixth book, hopefully this wait is not eternal.",106,9
Kindle_Store,B0077PIFA8,"I'm absolutely never disappointed by Tim's books!  It's always a wild ride and I find myself trying to slow down while reading so I don't finish the book so fast, because I know I'll just want more!  Now I'm eagerly awaiting Kiera's next adventure!",44,10

Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,"I read her other book on weight loss on Medifast and loved it.  I wondered if I should also get this one.  Glad I did.  New insights, new slant, and new laughter! I saw myself and my struggle in each day's journal entry. This is a fantastic read for anyone on Medifast.",52,0
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,I found Suddenly Skinny Day By Day to be a very inspirational accounting of one woman's weight loss journey. Her tenacity certainly paid off and serves to show the rest of us in the same struggle how dogged determination WILL get us to our goals if we just make the right choices in every moment and then act on those choices. Freya's story will surely inspire those in need of encouragement in their pursuit of thinness.,76,1
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,"Having my own battle with weight influenced my decision to buy this book. I applaud Taylor's efforts for losing so much weight, I fear that she her eating issues started to become a different kind of eating disorder. Therefore, halfway through I stopped feeling inspired and more discouraged.",48,2
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,This lady did all of the hardwork for you in putting your thoughts on paper.  You will find that she has read your mind and she knows because she has been there.  Very handy for Medifast users.,37,3
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,Very inspirational!! Made me think that maybe I can do it too and turn my life around. Very proud of your accomplishments :),23,4
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,Good for those of us beginning the mf journey.  Congrats to Freya for her success and encouragement for peeps to go all in!,23,5
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,"This was nothing comparable to Freya's other book.  This is AWFUL!!!!  Nothing but I love MF, I love MF, I love MF, I love MF, get the picture? She loves MF (MediFast).  And it really has left me wondering how anyone could possible love that program if they are starving and suffering hunger pain for months on end, constantly is fatigued and cold, and is experiencing brain fog and openly states that with her head like that she can't make any kind of decisions or do any critical thinking.  Congrats on the weight loss but I really have to wonder if this was a healthy way to lose the weight and whether or not this would be a sustainable lifestyle change.  I doubt it very much.  Living on high-protein real substitutions and a few leafy greens and low-fat protein isn't the way to go.  (Speaking from experience-lost 52 lbs. in 5 months EATING a well-balanced diet not exceeding 1450 calories a day & exercising.)  Sorry, this book will only bore you, or hopefully, make you want to lose weight in a healthy manner that includes healthy food, not starving, not being constantly hungry, etc.",194,6
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,Weak. heard it all before. bet shes put it all back on now that shes back to eating affordable food.,20,7
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,Very helpful book since i am on Medifast.  The writer was able to communicate very honest approach on her journey (using Mediast).  I would recommend this book.,27,8
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,"In this book, Freya Taylor provides an honest and uplifting account of her weight loss journey.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about her daily thoughts and feelings as she embraced the challenge of overcoming a lifetime of being overweight.  Being on a similar journey of using the same Medifast plan for weight loss, I found myself identifying with so much of what she said.  Her success and determination to succeed provided me with true inspiration to follow in her footsteps and continue on my way to being 'skinny'.  I read this book for the first time in early 2014.  I lost 80 pounds, and have kept the weight off for one year.  I would read Freya's reflections to keep me motivated. I highly recommend this book to anyone contemplating or currently living the experience of losing weight. You won't be disappointed!",140,9
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,I really enjoyed this book/diary/memoir. I've recently started my own weight loss journey and I enjoy reading about other people's weight loss experiences for inspiration. This was fun and inspirational.,30,10
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,Very inspiring and down to earth.  This will be a wonderful reference to anyone using Medifast to change their life.,20,11
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,"While Freya used Medifast for her weight loss, transition, and maintenance (as am I), this journal is a great resource for anyone losing weight.  She brings up the highs and lows of both obesity and weight loss.  It's amazing to see her attitude transform over time.  Very encouraging to me in weight loss journey.",54,12
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,This book was fun and easy to read.  I went on the same program last year with great success and have since become a coach for the program.  I have one client that could have wrote this book word for word and I see myself in some of this book as well.,52,13
Kindle_Store,B007C7TSWU,I have read and reread Freya's book.  It's very informative and quite humorous!  Seriously a great read for anyone struggling with losing weight.,23,14
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,Not worth the $4.99 that I spent. Did not help me at all. Save your money.,16,0
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,Total waste. No real information or tips. The author should have just had a link pointing to the PRIME site. No hidden gems or anything. Certainly do NOT pay for this book. I'm glad I didn't.,36,1
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"Really?  This was just a short explanation of Amazon Prime - no tricks or strategies. I expected some extra instructions on how to look for movies, books etc..so I could utilize my membership more efficiently.  Guess I'll just keep fumbling around!",41,2
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"good primer to get started when you do not know a lot about amazon prime, it worked for me and helped",21,3
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"I had to purchase this to actually find out details about Amazon Prime that is conveniently averted when searching for answers.  At the VERY END it tells me that it is not compatible with mobile devices.

Awesome. Purchase for nothing.",40,4
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"Wow...I opened the book, started reading, and five minutes later, I turned the page and it was over.  I probably would have gotten the same info on the Amazon web page.  Oh well.",33,5
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"pretty much the worst ebook I've read. absolutely nothing interesting or original, just a regurgitation of Amazon help pages. every bit of info can be found right in Amazon help, no need to download this even if it is free.

def. worth the price I paid: zero.",47,6
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"trying to decide - seems a lot of $$ as I do not order much, but am using Kindle books more and more, and also the streaming aspect is nice for my ipad --- the only problem with that, however, is the amazon prime free instant videos are stopping and buffering a LOT, and this does not happen with Netflix so it is not a problem with my wifi.. really kind of a bummer.",74,7
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,Lots of things to learned from this  book. Refer to it quite often and it has been very helpful.thank you.,20,8
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"my mistake, should have used my prime and downloaded it for free. I don't feel it gave much info in what i was wanting which was the streaming of movies and videos. I don't order a whole lot on line to take a big advantage of free shipping.  Did learn that prime membership will automatically renew so I will keep that in mind when my year is up in case i want to cancel if i fell not getting my moneys worth",82,9
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"I've been an amazon prime customer for years, so I didn't find anything in this book that I didn't already know.  I do think, though, that it would be very helpful for people who are considering prime membership.  By the time you finish the book, you have a very good understanding of all that prime has to offer.",58,10
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,Learned lots of new information that I didn't know about the Amazon prime program. great book. would recommend to anyone.,20,11

Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,"I am a true believer in the value of Amazon Prime.  This book has done a great job of collecting all the features into easy to read guide.  Some of the ideas included here, such as Student rates with the extended trial period, and the availability of streaming video are features of Prime I was unaware of. Thanks for this!",60,13
Kindle_Store,B00JFHKOAK,Just ok. Pretty basic information you probably can get from Amazon itself. Book was a really short read.  4 stars,20,14
Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,"I could not put this ""book"" down. Although I love series I hate not being able to keep going when the story is this good. Wonderful writing, great character development, with just the right amount of tortured love. A great read!",41,0

The second book continues the story of Alaysha as she tries to explore who she is and where she came from. As with the first book, this one is full of twists and turns and ends with a cliffhanger that will make you want to rush out and buy book 3. This is a great new fantasy series.",79,5

This book grabbed me right away, I was unable to put it down for too long.  As the story is unfolding, I am captured by the story of these witches.  I will read them and go back and read the others by this author.  I have found another FAVORITE author!",84,7
Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,"Awesome read!  I have been scouring Kindle Books for a new fantasy series that can keep my attention and this one definitely did.  It is also a breath of fresh air to read a fantasy story mainly from a female perspective and feeling real female emotions toward family, lovers, etc.  It doesn't take long to get attached to each of the characters and the end of Blood Witch kept me wanting more.  I can't wait till Bone Witch!  This was my first read by Thea Atkinson and I can see her becoming a pretty big deal in fantasy writing.",99,8
Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,Strange plot but will hold your interest.  Different way of looking at things not sure I will continue this series.  It is a bit much to believe.,27,9

.  didn't want to put it down. I was drawn into their lives as if my own family.",21,10
Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,I'm waiting for the prequel. Can't wait to keep reading. Love it when an author can open you up to a character the way Thea. Atkinson can.,27,11
Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,"I liked the feel of this novel, the world building, the sense of melancholy and mystery. The main character was an interesting person, with some depth and a little development. She even managed to keep from being the formulaic ""kick-butt heroine"". My only complaint would be that it moved a bit slowly at times, and I do despise novels where it is obvious that one or more of the characters knows what is going on and refuses to tell the heroine. Makes it feel like the author is just pulling my chain as long as she can. This one wasn't so bad, and I'm glad I read it. Some good seeds for a sequel there, but no horrible cliff hangers at the end. I would recommend it.",127,12
Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,Very fresh and creative! I loved the whole series!,9,13
Kindle_Store,B0097656BQ,"Second in the series, this book continues with Alaysha trying to find out more about herself and her roots.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0018FZIUS,"Darren is one of those artists who never fails to disappoint in live performance, and he can pull off a great show no matter the size of the venue, and number of people in the audience.
The Time Machine Tour proved he could pull off a show that most artists would dare only do in an arena type environment.  With help from Willie Williams (who has done set designs etc for U2 and the like), Darren proves he can have the show of his dreams & keep the audience entertained at the same time.
The show shows off some tracks from his recent cd release ""This Delicate Thing We've Made"" along with tracks from his previous solo releases plus some Savage Garden songs too.

The songs are great, although the recording is a little ""tinney"".  The beginning of ""What a Shame"" always gets my foot tapping.

Lonesome Dave is right on his game in this one.  ""Feel So  Bad"" is absolutely my favorite song of all, and that is saying  something. They had so many good ones.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000032Q4,"and i've been a fan since. i first heard this album back in 1975 and in those days i was a stones, zepplin and who freak. not much else mattered. but this album opened up some doors for me. i just could not get over the rawness of some of the songs, eight days on the road for example. nor could i ignore the fact that this album just rocks and rolls from start to finish. it may not be their best album (fool for the city is i think), but this runs a close second.i wish i could have seen  Foghat live. other than the beatles or hendrix i wish i would have seen these guys. great rock and roll.",121,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000032Q4,"The first foghat , while being a cool cd is produced in a way to lessen the sound of the boogie guitars and that didn't happen here.  This was a solid rocker that explodes out on songs like 'road fever' , nothing is muted here and this was a band moving away from the savoy brown  pure blues rockin' sound into a great boogie rocker band and they suceeded here masterfully. In fact they continued it through the end of the decade , then for a while they released a more new wavish boogie rock sound that is still good but this is classic foghat all the way.",108,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000032Q4,"This one came out before FOOL FOR THE CITY and is what projected them to the level that FOOL FOR THE CITY was able to ride on. By far my favorit. Belive it or not FOGHAT was the METALICA of the 70's,lol!! If you have a guitar player in your house, get this for them. A treasure chest of of rifs and licks that will keep them busy for years. My Lord the song CHATEAU LAFITTE '59 BOOGIE is worth the cost itself. See if you can get the double package deal with ROCK AND ROLL OUTLAWS / FOOL FOR THE CITY. Even check out ROD PRICE'S SOLO CD, OPEN. You'll love it !!But belive me. Every body need's ROCK AND ROLL OUTLAWS. Makes a great b-day and x-mas gift }:-) Thanks again, JaminJim !!",135,6

Actually A lot of 'HAT fans were confused about it! While 8-DAYS ON THE ROAD and,CHATEAU LAFITTE '59 BOOGIE dominate the album,the title track is my fav. Always thought it should have been on a ""GREATEST HITS""somewhere.

ROCK ON!",93,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000032Q4,"This is a quality album start to finish! I've often thought Foghat was one of the most overlooked bands of the 70's. This band is often remembered for ""Slow Ride"" and ""Fool for the City"" but this band has much more to offer. Foghat rocks with the best of them on this album, with their blend of re-worked blues, such as ""I Feel So Bad"", and staight forward hard driving classics, such as ""Ride, Ride, Ride"". Also there are 2 fine ballads on this album, ""It's Too Late"" and ""Couldn't Make Her Stay"". This album is a ""must have"" for fans of  70's Rock and Roll,  no music collection would be complete without.",113,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000032Q4,"This album (with the rock and the roll) and ""Fool for the City"" are probably Foghat's two best.  I never heard much of this album played on the radio but when I heard ""What a Shame"" played on a juke box I had to have this record.  Foghat took into the 70's a sound that to me seemed to evolve from 60's rock, which I considered a plus.  I just wish ""Terraplane Blues"" was on this CD instead of on ""Fool for the City"".  I think it would go better with this album.  Foghat was also one of the best bands to hear live.  Lonesome Dave passed away about 3 and a half years ago.  Maybe not, but to me it seemed like this was one of the bands that suffered from the disco wave that began in the mid 70's.  But disco was a fad, this is some prime rock and roll that should be in every 70's rock collection.",161,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0000032Q4,"This album is easily 5 stars, the very best that Foghat ever made.  There's great variety here, too.  This was their most creative piece of work. The best song is Chateau LaFitte '59 Boogie.  It still is, and always  has been my favorite Foghat tune.  If you like Foghat and don't have this  in your collection, you're really missing out.  This is a ""must  have"" ..... no disappointments, guaranteed!",69,14

When I started reading the book my first reaction was ""Oh no, same story different point of view"". But I quickly changed my opinion and I dare say I like the second book more than the first and what really won me was  Jayne and the thing she symbolizes - her hard childhood, the need to prove herself and to keep fighting against the world and her ability to get past her infertilness and to love a children not of her blood.",84,0
Kindle_Store,B0076OCDVM,I think I liked this book better than the first Divinity Warriors Book!  I can't wait to see where the rest of the series goes!  Loved it!,27,1
Kindle_Store,B0076OCDVM,"Great,wonderful,author can not write fast enough, would have no problem reading more of this authors titles. couldn't put it down, great story line.  YYEsssss, getting my fix!!",27,2
Kindle_Store,B0076OCDVM,"I really enjoyed reading all 4 (to date) of her Divinity Warriors series.  The characters were well developed (particularly the heroine), the scenes well described, and I enjoyed the antics of the women.  Ms. Pillow did a great job of weaving the stories of the other 3 women into each book.  I thought the premise of the stories and the way she told each story was original.  I struggled between giving this series a 4 or a 5 and went with the 4 only because the writing was not as ""tight"" as some of the other authors I read in this genre.  That being said, I believe you'll really like this book if you like others in this genre.  Get all four.",122,3
Kindle_Store,B0076OCDVM,"This is the second book in the Divinity Warriors series and once again I was pulled into the series at once.  This book starts where the first book did but from the perspective of the second of the 4 woman Jayne.  We follow her adventures from picking her warrior, to changing her mind and finally to accepting that this is where she belongs.  I really enjoyed the ending and hope there will be a least another novella picking up right from there.",82,4
Kindle_Store,B0076OCDVM,"Loving this series. I enjoyed this book just as much as the last. I like how the author retells the story from the point of view of a different character, so you won't have any issues picking up one of these books mid-series. Great writing, great plot, great idea. Love.",50,5
Kindle_Store,B0076OCDVM,"I think Jayne might be one of my favorite heroines from this series.  I love that she is a strong woman coming into things.  I love that she decides straight away that she's not going to be a simpering woman who agrees to do whatever is asked of her in this strange new place, she's going to forge her own way. It was also pretty awesome how she then flips tables on Ronen, choosing him and pretty much making him choose her.

The Divinity Warrior stories take you to a different world, with different laws and traditions and unfortunately the woman just sort of wind up there,usually without their prior knowledge, but each of the women take their own path to finding that they truly belong right where they've landed.  It is always fun to watch the men and women both figure out how to make things work, once they admit to their true feelings.

I love how Michelle Pillow shows the connection between the characters and then expands on it to  show how they grow together as a couple, and that it's not without its difficulties. It adds a level of realism to an otherwise out of this world story.",201,6

Ronen had no intention of claiming a wife. However, Jayne did an unexpected move and chose him. The two have several interesting interactions as they are both working to gain the upper hand in the relationship. I loved this story and how no matter what Ronen comes after Jayne and does not let her go.",123,12
Kindle_Store,B0076OCDVM,"Fighting Lady Jayne was plenty of fight and plenty of indecision.  I did enjoy the read on FLJ but there were some instances where I wanted to throw some punches, most notably were the back and forth of making any decision for Jayne.  It was understandable based on her history to be a bit hesitant but it became overwhelming at how many times when she did so.
Ronen, her chosen mate played his role well.  For such a strong warrior race, he stuck to beliefs and then did the one thing that showed how much he truly loved Jayne.  He gave her FREEDOM.  And that's the thing about what we want sometimes, it's not always what it's cracked up to be.  I really liked Ronen's character in this story more than the heroine.  I felt she was more childish and had a tendency toward tantrums when things just weren't going how she wanted them.  I found it very hard indeed to like Jayne.

Overall I did like the basis of the story which is why I did give it at least the 4 stars...we can thank Ronen for that bit.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002O1W,"This cd has some of George Strait's signature songs, such as ""Fool Hearted Memory,"" ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and  ""You Look So Good in Love.""  There is more honky-tonk flavor in ""Unwound,"" and ""Down and Out,"" than any song he's released since.  All together, this is a great cd, a must-have for any George Strait fan.

I cannot with good conscience leave a 5 star rating, although every song on here is of 5 star caliber, simply because other collections that have been released are far more encompassing, and with more songs, are a much better value.  This cd was released 25 years ago, and the songs on it are still played daily on country music radio.  That alone should tell you about the quality of this cd.",127,0

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002O1W,"This is a good album for anyone who is a George

Strait fan.

Strait's cover of Terry Stafford's 1973 hit,

""Amarillo By Morning"" is the centerpiece of the

album, and deserves a little attention.

While Strait's version of this song is probably the

most similar to Stafford's original performance,

with all the improvements in instrumentation,

it still lacks something of the spirit of the original.

Maybe it's the different style of backing vocals.

Still a decent cover, and since Stafford's version

isn't likely to become available on CD any time soon,

it's probably as good as we're gonna get.",99,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002O1W,"George Strait is one of those artists that can never have enough hits collections. As long as he is selling records and topping the charts, hits collections will just keep on coming.

And, Strait's original, the 1985 'Greatest Hits' release spanning George's first three records is essential. Yes, it's really skimpy, and it's only 10 songs long, but so what? It's still really definitve, and it gives the casual fan who wants nothing but classic George what they are looking for.

I'd recommend this over '50 Number Ones,' which features really bad single edits so 51 songs could fit on two CDs. But these are the full length album versions, digitally remastered to sound great. MCA gets extra pointers for remastering this.

I also like the song choice here. 'You Look So Good In Love,' 'Right Or Wrong,' 'A Fire I Can't Put Out,' 'Unwound,' and 'Marina Del Rey' all appear on this set, which are some of his finer songs.

Highly recommended for any George Strait fan. A great CD to own. ENJOY!!!",174,5

One classic after another-Unwound, If You're Thinking You Want  a Stranger, Right or Wrong, Let's Fall to Pieces Together, and the  hauntingly sad Amarillo By Morning.  I could hear them all a thousand times  and never get tired of them.  I'm sure everyone has those certain songs  that they like to sing along with in the car and they don't care who's  watching and I'm no exception.  THESE are the songs that I sing along to,  and I couldn't care less who is watching.  I may look like a complete idiot  going down the road, but that's OK because I'm singing along with my music  hero George Strait.

Hopeless Romantic & At This Moment are special songs for anyone but the rest of the disc is great. Why didn't I get this earlier.. I had both songs on vinyl... yes vinyl and just wasn't sure about how good the rest of the music would be but geez it's good. So ""do yourself a favour"" and buy it viewers you won't regret it ever.",83,10

Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"Raising an infant comes with a number of challenges built in, perhaps the greatest of which is, your infant cannot effectively communicate his or her needs to you. This results in a lot of crying, sleepless nights, and general unhappiness. It turns out, however, that humans have the capacity for signing well before they can speak. Asselin's book will help you use that to your parental advantage, showing you how to teach your infant basic sign language (this technique is also helpful for children with learning disabilities, and, naturally, deafness).",90,0
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,I have finished Barb's Raising a Happy Child book about using baby sign language with your baby and I can see how using these techniques would really help to alleviate the stress and frustration of babies who are too young to talk but trying to communicate.  The best part is that it really does only take a few minutes a day to reinforce what you are teaching.  Great ideas that I will pass on to the young parents in my life.  Thanks!,82,1
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,This book is really easy to follow and I learned some new signs along with refreshing my memory of old signs.,21,2
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"I love the idea of teaching babies ASL.  I have read Barbs other book, On signing letters, and have been playing with my granddaughter practicing letters.  This is going to take our play to a different level, by allowing me to show her words now.  I'm so excited to start these lessons with her.",54,3
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"Communication with kids is key. This book gives parents a jumpstart on communication with their children from the time time they are an infant. The words used n this book are great because they are the common words kids use everyday to communicate. If your child is experiencing hearing impairments, has a learning disability or was born with genetic disorders, this book is for you!  Even if your child is healthy, this book is still for you too!! We should be teaching our children different languages and with the help of this book, your child can be diverse with knowing another language.",102,4
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,I love the idea of sign language for babies unfortunately I wasn't aware of it when I had babies I would have loved to do that. I thought the book was a great help for parents and the pictures of each sign will have you signing in no time.,49,5
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"What a great idea to use early child sign language in a tool of communication. This book is a must for new parents. Not only will it help to ""talk"" to your baby, but also strengthens the bond between parents and child.",42,6

Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"I initially picked up this book as a KDP Select Promo. I began glancing over the book and found myself reading more and more, and soon I was done with it. The book is full of useful information to prepare you in case your child is born deaf. I found it fascinating how easy these steps would be to follow in helping your child develop normally, despite the disability. My wife want to have a child and I am terrified at the prospect. Having a book like this, for a man like me (a complete planner) would be a godsend to me, plus it opens your eyes to what the parents of a deaf child go thru.
Well written, easy to follow instructions and diagrams.",125,8
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"Every parent knows the frustration of having their 6-month-old child screaming and not having a clue why. Are they sick? Are they hungry? Are they tired? It can drive you nuts, and must be pretty frustrating for the kid as well. Teaching your kids basic signs opens up a whole new world - a world where you can actually communication with each other!

Knowing that Barb went through this process with her own kids means she can be trusted; she has literally been there and done it. The book is easy to understand and I love the photos of her kids showing the signs!",104,9
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,This has to be one of the bet books I have seen on sign language.  The illustrations are clear and the book covers a wide variety of everyday words.  It also give guidance on when and how to start using sign language with your child.,45,10
Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"As this book describes, baby sign language  takes a lot of mystery out of the first year of parenting, since a child's ability to communicate develops before their ability to speak. This book is fully of short tips that are easy to implement immediately.",44,11

Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,This is a well-written and useful resource for parents of small children. ASL can be useful for anyone who wants to better communicate with very young children.

Kindle_Store,B00G1M3TM2,"Barb Asselin has written a terrific book here.  Very informative on how to use sign language with children.  A close friend of mine has a 3 year old that I think would benefit from reading this, I will be sending them a link today!",44,14

Happy reading.",104,12

.",22,13
Kindle_Store,B00CLRWA9Y,"This book left you wanting more. The characters were one dimensional. No growth. The main character was whiny and a push-over. I usually like any book I read one way or another, even if it is because you can see in their writing that they tried to make a good book but this wasn't even proof read. I was mad but thank goodness it was free. The love scenes were rushed and boring. I did like the nephew and TR. That was the only redeeming quality. Would not read another book by Sarah unless she put much more work into it. I do respect you for trying, but it was half-......ed

One minute he was Pop Pop then Paw Paw. One minute it was the Blue Line restaurant, then the Green Line then back to Blue Line.

To the author: How can you expect us to want to read it, when you didn't even read it yourself?",157,14

Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"Very good buy, help me to expand my knowledge of the guitar and the implications of this, I do not regret buying, I recommend it.",25,1
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"Good book, enough pictures to entertain without any thought and enough insight to actually learn something. Step by step diagram ananlysis on on a basic circut degsign and a n amp build very interesting.",34,2
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,Every unique chapter in this book is fantastic!  It's like having a starter library all in one book. You can't find a better all-round book covering tube guitar amps (the only way to go) than this one.,37,3
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"Buy it! If you have any interest at all in how your guitar amplifier works, you need this book - I can't recommend it anymore than that! Dave has authored more books from Publisher Backbeat Books, and they're all killer productions - great/informative writing,  superb binding, covers and great detail in the publishing aspects of these books.

Dave Hunter is well versed in all things guitar, as I have learned through buying and reading all of his works to date. He's got a unique book here in his approach and honesty on the subject, and it's worth every penny. Loaded with real world, no BS information - great sections on signal chain, components, how to select the right amp for you and at the end, a fully documented amplifier kit (which is now available through the publisher's website) which you can either buy direct, or put together with your own parts!

Highly recommended, and I highly recommend Dave's other books as well!",162,4
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"This book is enough to get you going with tube amps. It's enough for you to understand the tube amp project in the book and build it. The amplifier sounds really good, louder than I expected. The book doesn't get into much electrical engineering as it seems to me to be an introduction. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater understanding of their tube amp or even build one.",72,5
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"Not quite finished reading it yet,but the book is very interesting to read if you enjoy reading technical related material. It is a must for any tube amp owner as it explains the basics of amp design and tube operation! It also explains how the signal travels from your guitar all the way through to the speaker. Will give more complete review when finished reading!",65,6
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"I was expecting more of a hands-on book than this. A great book for understanding how amplifiers work, which is very interesting. This book is a great first book to read if you'd like to make your own amp some day.",41,7
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"I was looking for a book to help me in constructing my own.  This wasn't that, but it still is fun to read if you're into amps.",27,8
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,Easy to read and understand without having to go back and read over again. I found it to be a delight to read.,23,9
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"This is a very well written book intended for the person who wants to know more about how an amplifier works.  The sections are broken into easy to decipher catagories - great for the newbie neophyte.  I covers all the primary areas from tubes to speakers to boxes re: TONE!

IF simpler is better then this is as simple as it can get for such a complicated subject.

Don't forget to heed his warnings in the back of the book re: voltages.  Messing around with a part at the wrong time CAN kill you - ESPECIALLY charged up capacitors!  Learn the very simple trick used to discharge capacitors by going to your local electronics store and just asking them!  I could tell you but its better to go and seek the answer yourself because you'll be more likely to retain the knowledge!

The forever bottom line:  Make sure you KNOW with perfect clarity what you are doing before you do it!

Thanks for completing this undertaking Dave!  God Bless!

Sincerely,

Charles Thomas",172,10
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"Great book. Poor transcription into Kindle. The Kindle edition has too many typos, e is c, voltage is voltrog, etc. I'm wondering if the system used to scan a printed book into a Kindle edition is misreading the text and no one takes the time to proof read for the errors. I can usually figure out from context what the typo really meant to say, but... the biggest problem I found in just one hour with this book involved a 47uF 400V axial capacitor listed in the parts list for the Two Stroke Amp project. It was supposed to call for a .47uF 400V axial capacitor. This missing decimal, factor of 100, typo could cause some serious problems and ruin the project. Unforgivable. I want my money back to spend on the printed version of this otherwise useful book.",139,11
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"This book is somewhat similar to the tube amp book by Aspen Pittman but I think it is much better.  Dave has included several interviews by very knowledgable people in the world of tube amps, most notably Ken Fisher.

While the book does not contain any real amp modification suggestions, it does have various philosophies on modifications and the persuit of great tone.

I was pleasantly supprised and would buy it again.

-Don",73,12
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,"I learned a lot from this book!  I manage a high end guitar boutique and had basic knowledge of tonal and functionality differences between certain amps and brands.  After reading this book I have learned some important history behind some of the classic amp designs, learned some key terminology in regards to all aspects of the guitar amplifier and cabinet and everything that goes into the build from start to finish. I especially liked the interviews at the end of the book with some of the best builders out there.

I have to admit, without a background in electronics, it is hard to get excited about the technical descriptions in this book, however, after reading about similar parts in many classic amps, I at least feel like I have a better understanding of how to talk amps with friends and customers of mine.

I recommend this book to guitarists looking for historical and basic conversational knowledge of amps.  You may even be inspired to gather parts for your own amp build.  I know I'm going to! Time to source out parts for a 2x10 tweed combo based on the tweed super! :)",192,13
Kindle_Store,B004CRTAIA,Useful technical details of various classic amps.  The history of the art is interesting reading but the interview with amp designers is fascinating.,23,14

Kindle_Store,B00NXCDUCM," I came across this free on Amazon and the cover pulled me in. I know that it is only the prequel to the Seduce Me Series. I like this little tidbit is what can easily pull you in. It is a little introduction of what is come. Give a little insight to some of the main character.
 I guess it gives us Brandon Mitchell and Ashley Sullivan. All because Ashley wants to work at his fashion magazine. It was a short read. I can't wait to read more of the series. This just was not long enough. I don't want to give anything away.",104,2
Kindle_Store,B00NXCDUCM,If you like a lot of repetitious sex scenes without much story telling and intrigue then this is the book for you. Just not my cup of tea. It was short and it was finally starting to build up an intriguing story and then it suddenly ended. I won't be finding out what happens next.,55,3
Kindle_Store,B00NXCDUCM,A good book.  Not at all what I expected. Would not recommend reading this book if you are not going to ready the other four books in the series.,29,4

Kindle_Store,B00NXCDUCM,"Disappointed because of so many fan recommendations. I am going to say, just not my cup of tea. I just couldn't be engaged to the writing nor the story. This felt more like an extended prelude/intro than the beginning storyline to a series that left me not interested enough to invest in a new=to-me author. I think I am in the minority given her other reviews though so no harm, no foul.",72,7
Kindle_Store,B00NXCDUCM,"What an interesting, blurb really, of the Seduce Me series. The writing was not broken and encouraged moving on to part 1 of the series.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,Nice adaptation of the show to the screen. Rick Moranis in the best part of his career. And having Ellen Greene preserved on film as Audrey is wonderful.

The best track ""Downtown (Skid Row)"" not to be confused with Petula Clark's version, this one is far catchier and very much the feeling of coming home to a less than posh neighborhood after a long day. ""Suddenly Semour"" comes in second with stunning vocals from both lead characters and the theme is cute and catchy. I'm so happy to see the actual soundtrack is still available, I'm going to pick one up right now. (Hey, check out the movie, too. It's great!)",109,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"I agree with the top critical review. Although this cd is from the movie, it's noticeably different than the official movie soundtrack.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000OQ7,"This is one of the best soundtracks of all time. The music, from Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, is easily better than their work for Disney. The pop influence is great.

Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,No tatting book is ever worth it's salt that doesn't have pictures.  Not only can you not see what you are making but its impossible to decide which pattern you want to make.  it's also helpful to have the pictures to clarify instructions.,43,3
Kindle_Store,B004UJW8ES,It's intended for a 19th or 20th century woman who knows how to tat. There are no instructions or photos/illustrations of the finished pieces let alone steps on how to get there. The language is also dated.,37,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"""It Matters to Me"" is the perfect reprieve from Faith's pop album ""Breathe"".  Listening to the songs ""Someone Else's Dream"" (#1) and ""Let's Go To Vegas"" (#2) reminds me, as well as Faith's other country fans, of that special twang that *was* Faith Hill.  One of the best songs on this album is the powerful ""A Man's Home Is His Castle"" (#5).  This song depicts a woman who is abused and unfairly dominated by her husband.  The title track, ""It Matters to Me"" (#3) is a heartfelt song that realistically speaks about communication in a relationship.  Also, the spiritual ""Keep Walkin' On"" (#10) with Shelby Lynne is a great number that ends the record nicely.  This album is an incredible work that's bunches of fun- you'll love it!",128,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,I really enjoy Faith Hill CD's.  This one was just as enjoyable.  It does have a good selection of songs.,20,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"You don't need to have faith to listen to this CD. She is still the Queen and this CD has a good selection that proves her voice and style is very good. This is early Faith Hill, a little more country than her later pop.",45,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"While it doesn't have monster hits like ""Take Me As I Am"" had (e.g. ""Wild One"", ""Piece Of My Heart) , this album is more consistent overall.

Everything on here is at least above average.

Most are good to very good.

I cannot give this a full 5 stars, because 2 of Carrie Underwood's albums are significantly better and definitely earned 5 stars.  However, I would have given this close to 4.25 stars had we been able to use partial stars.

As far as individual songs, ""It Matters To Me"" gets an ""A-"" from me.

Everything else on this album ranges from a B- to a B+.

Very consistent quality, even though there isn't the mega hits as in her other albums.  But that is perfectly fine, I think good to very good consistent quality is a lot better than having a mega hit and lots of mediocrity (see ""Breathe"", ""Faith"" albums).

Overall, this is a B+ album in my opinion, barely below an A-.  My favorite of her albums, with ""Take Me As I am"" as a close second.

Faith was definitely at her best in her first 2 albums.",191,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,I bought this cd to get to songs  but did hear two more it do enjoy love the song of the whole CD and would buy again.,27,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"I like Faith's later music up to a point, but this is my favorite of hers. I yearn for the day when she makes another album like this - after her hit-making days are over, perhaps?
The songs are variously feisty (Bed of roses, You will be mine), just plain fun (Viva Las Vegas) or serious (A man's home is his castle, about domestic violence). There's even a gospel duet (Keep walkin' on) with the great Shelby Lynne.
The whole feel of the album is country, albeit with a contemporary edge, very different from Faith's later albums. Some of the sad songs have upbeat backing music, so if you don't listen too closely you may not realise just how sad they really are.
This is a brilliant album. Following on from her debut (Take me as I am), another brilliant album, I expected more of the same to follow. It didn't, but her later albums are not as bad as some would have you believe.",165,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"The songs I like on this CD: ""Someone eles dream"", ""Let's go to vegas"", It matter to me"", you can't lose me"" and "" I can't do that any more"". Are the songs I like.  Faith you can do better than that. I like the song ""Let's make love"" with Tim. It not on this CD it's on Breathe, but I like the song anyways.",65,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"I Like Faith Hill Because She Is Pretty And Sings Good Songs. I Like This CD. The Songs I Like On This CD Are: ""Let's Go To Vegas"", The Title Track, And My Favorite Of Them All ""You Can't Lose Me"".",41,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,Love the album. I have come to accept this quality from Faith Hill. She has a beautiful voice that stands out above many of her counterparts in Country Music today.,30,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"This is proof that Faith Hill actually used to be a country singer. You can listen to this album straight through without skipping songs - they're all great. She has a sweet, tender, country voice and the songs are very  well written. Excellent album!",44,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002MXG,"This album has some sassy songs along with ""It Matters to Me"" and ""I can't do That Anymore,"" which are plaintive and lovely.  ""A Man's Home is His Castle"" is a good story song.  Basically this album has everything good about country on it.",44,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"Gave this a 3 because of the music, the vocals give it a minus 2 since they actually distract from the awesome music.

 This was a good starting album but it just misses melody. the music is kick ass the entire way threw, now take away the vocals and you have a great instrumental album but the vocals leave you wanting something you can understand, it's like listening to someone gasp for air and then spitting on a microphone for an hour. hey if you're into that then by all means go spend $15 on it but if you want something with some melody and alot better vocalist get ""The End of Heartache"". Such a great improvement not only vocally but also musically, they made the perfect decision getting the new singer, not only can you understand the new singer when he's screaming his lungs out but his voice during melodic parts is great.",154,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"Man,comparing kse in their early days to now i just gotta say they were way heavier and better. Yeah since jesse left they haven't been that good anymore end of the heartache was a cool album but the newest stuff is kinda weak,howard is not that good of a singer jesse was wayyyy better. Get this one is pure heavy metal unlike their new stuff this is something you can actually rock to GET IT THEY WON'T BE HEAVY LIKE THIS ANYMORE!",82,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"The second disc is a big improvement, but this one is a great start. I say that big fans should own this disc, but most likely you'll find yourself wanting to play ""Alive or still breathing"" rather than this one. Simply because it has better playing, better songs, and better production. Yet, this is more raw sounding, so some people might actually like it better if they get off on that sorta thing. if you're new to the band though, I suggest starting with ""alive or still breathing""...
now, I just want to comment on some of the things I read in other reviews... first off, Killswitch OWNS Pantera and besides, Pantera actually aren't around anymore, so according to that guy Killswitch now reign supreme.
and, this is not how Metallica should sound....P>long live Killswitch Engage!!",136,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"First off i cant believe what the real metalhead from ohio said, Everything besides killswitch on Roadrunner is Nu-metal garbage?he must not even know whos on roadrunner, What about Cradle of Filth? Obituary? Chimaira? Deicide? Are you out of your freaking gord man? Why don't you go check roadrunners roster on their website, all kinds of ""real"" metal bands on roadrunner.
To the cd, best tracks are Rusted Embrace, Vide nfra, Soilborn.
Very good album overall, not enough of it though.",81,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,hey if you like these guys check out aftershock through the looking glass its a great cd and it has members of killswitch engage before they were in killswitch engage but its a good cd check it,37,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"not the best band out there. Gotta remember they are nu-metal. Not much talent here. Vocals are not bad, would be nice to hear less screaming. Have to agree this is not very heavy at all. For some heavy bands check out slayer, megadeth or napalm death. Killswitch has some potential and i hope to see something better from them in the future",63,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"Killswitch Engage is one of the most amazing bands. This album is so much different from the other bands we see now. KsE truly standout. The Element of One, Self Revolution, and pretty much the whole album is just an epiphany in its works. I was speechelss when i once got the cd and heard it through. I am still amazed at the effort made making this album. He has a voice with different personalities. He goes from angry to just soft structured hymns. Its mindblowing. The guitars are impossible sounding. The guitar work is so amazing, its hard to even tell thats guitar. Its an amazing album. For fans of ShadowsFall, Norma Jean, and you get the idea. PICK THIS ALBUM UP.",123,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"The debut album from the now hugely popular Killswitch Engage. This album is very good. It is the basic metalcore formula of most bands deemed generic, but it just seems so fresh and powerful. Everything on this album fits perfectly together. This is an album that seems like Killswitch Engage put out with all of their focus. I am past my metalcore phase, but this is still a very good album. Highly recommended to anyone.",75,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"Firstly, for God's sake kids, if you are illiterate, no one will trust your judgement so stop writing reviews.

The most important thing to have in mind before listening to this record is that the majority of the songs don't come off as 'catchy' to the average listener. Unless you have a considerably distinct and developed taste and preference in Metal-core, Metal, or Hardcore, you're simply not going to be able to sit through Killswitch Engage's self titled record and enjoy it. Therefore, if you're a Nu-Metal, Punk, Ska... etc. fan, don't listen to records like this one and expect to be entertained -- and certainly don't review them, seriously.

The record is consistent, unrepetitive, and powerful.

However, it has only 9 tracks, 2 of which are not even songs and the actual songs are in my opinion, dragged out somewhat obnoxiously, lasting upwards of 5 minutes, at times, seeming as if the band members forgot that their songs need a chorus. I enjoy it very much but I am not going suggest that everyone go out and buy it. If you're a big KsE or metal fan, this cd is definitely worth the $10-12 dollars.",196,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"The guy at the bottom knows his stuff.  This album in my opinion is Killswitch's best by FAR.  I can't stand the new new singer's emo winey crap.  If you want a pure, brutal, unrelenting, totally kick a** METAL album pick this up.  Irreversal, Temple From the Within, Soilborn...every song is great.  And the best metal vocalist ever, period.  If you can't stand the new Killswitch like me and want to hear straight up kick a** metal then pick this one up.",82,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"If you like you music heavy and intricate, then ""Killswitch Engage"" is the band for you. This is what Metallica should be like. The soungs are straight in your face and the vocals are great (screaming to singing). None of that grunting crap. The songs all seem to stay in your head hours after the CD is over. This CD just went on my top 10 list. ...",68,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"it may not be worth the extra money just to get some songs you already own, but they sound a HELL of a lot better than the originals.

and to those who claim they've ""sold out"", shut up and listen to something else.  this was a great cd before, but the production values are very poor, and they made a great choice to fix it up and re-release it.

NOTE: I don't know if Amazon will delete this or not, but I went to Circuit City (a local electronic store for those of you who don't have one, check Best Buy) and this CD is $12.99.  No clue why it's so much on here, maybe because it's considered an import?",120,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00005Y7LP,"ok, the guy (Good riffs..cheesy vocals, January 19, 2004 Reviewer: A music fan from MA) who posted the statement about the cheesy vocals is obviously a new fan of KsE. Please take the time to read his review. Mr Music Fan from MA, if you ever take the time to read this know that KsE dropped your 'cheesy' vocalist (which i TOTALLY ABSOLUTELY disagree with as 'cheesy') Jesse Leach for new Blood Has Been Shed vocalist, *the* Howard Jones. If you listened to 'Alive or just Breathing' all the way thru, you will find that Jesse was a superb vocalist..even his quote ""opera singing."" When Darkness Falls off of Freddy vs Jason was Jones' first original recorded song with the band, so of course the vocalist will sound different-but you didn't know that so you won't have to die a slow and painful death after all. I don't own this album but i do own 'Alive' and its the greatest metal album ive ever heard so this will recieve 5 stars as well. I just saw this guys review and felt that i needed to respond",186,13

This is a contradiction, but so is war: live to die, kill to live, and paragraphs of the most exquisite poetic prose I have ever read, and I have read many, many books. But none like this one. Yeates goes further than mere war chronicle. He goes deep into the disintegrating soul of a pilot who lives through the war, and is left with nothing to live for. Sad, sad, sad. He gives you the exact mechanical moves of flying canvas airplanes armed with machine guns. Then he takes you into the inner life destroyed as he destroys the life of others. This is not to convict him of wrongdoing, but those who sent him to war with no understanding of what they were destroying: their world, their generation, and themselves. A truly amazing book. Give yourself time to find the rhythm of the story.",156,0
Kindle_Store,B005FA3W8C,"Since I am something of an aficionado of World War I aviation I dove into this book with glee as it is considered something of a classic in the genre. Sadly, I was ultimately disappointed. The book is at least 50 pages too long and could have benefited from a competent editor. There is a long meandering section dealing with sick leave that becomes tedious and there is entirely too much cumbersome philosophizing on politics, business, and world finance.

When the action takes to the air, the book is in fine form and the pages practically turn themselves. Also, anecdotes about aerodrome life and the civilians encountered in the neighboring French hamlets is amusing and worthwhile. Unfortunately, the book deviates from this formula too frequently. By the end of the book, I was hoping that some enterprising Hun would put the main character out of his (and my) misery.

Read Sagittarius Rising by Cecil Lewis for a more nuanced account of the air war or Fighting the Flying Circus for a breezy, thrilling look at WWI aviation seen through the eyes of America's highest scoring WWI ace, Eddie Rickenbacker.",189,1
Kindle_Store,B005FA3W8C,"I enjoyed the book very much.  However, the style of writing is definitely in the early 20th century type that is very flowery and poetic.  I compare the style to Zane Grey.

It is amazing to consider what these pilots had to endure, from not very reliable aircraft, poor flying conditions, frequent missions, no technology to aid them, machine gun fire and anti-aircraft fire from below and the German aviators. Daunting at all times. When starting this read one must adjust for the vocabulary of the time it was written but this is quickly overcome and not a problem.

('ma' is no joke either: big john is my name, smiling faces)  just had to give this one some justice. i got the lp...grooves 'bout gone. but i too would just like to give RARE EARTH some props. they definitely should be in motown's hall of fame. and by chance someone could ressurect 'one world' and 'willie remembers'...please don't cheat us,...give us the full funk (songs in their full lenghts)",189,0

At this stage though, it is only the very wealthy that can afford it.",78,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000008JSU,I was fortunate enough to see Rare Earth in concert a few times and they were one of the best jam bands around. They captured their spirit on this album.

This live version of ""Big Brother"" with Pete Rivera telling the fans to get out of the water, and that start of the song, if that doesn't get your motor running, check your pulse.

The only person I felt bad for was Madeline- but in the end, she was tough as nails- not fragile at all. This reminded me of 'Fatal Attraction' a little- just less gruesome at the end and it had a wife with a back bone. I am just left wondering..... Was Julianne ever really pregnant?  She didn't show when she visited Madeline yet was further along then Madeline in her pregnancy. Madeline's baby bump showed where Julianne's did not.  Also, she is drugged beyond belief in the end.

I downloaded all three books, read through them and was pleased with what I read. Imagine my dismay when i got to the ending and there was no closure to the story. The less female character's story was told in a one page epilogue. Come on! It was like the ending of this book was an afterthought. TERRIBLE ending to a fairly decent story.

Better luck in the future. Get an editor!!!,66,0
Kindle_Store,B006LAX8K2,"Well this book appeared along with a group of non fiction survival stories, and so I bought it thinking it was non fiction. The description also does not give any clues that it could be fiction. I was caught out all the way up to the part when ""Smithy"" shoots the bear with a flare gun. Up to that point i had overlooked the grammar and style as it was an amazing story of survival, but after that, its all i could focus on. I think its a great story for young children, I would certainly have read it to my children along with the Hardy Boys, but for me, in this stable ""fact"" is far more interesting than fiction.",120,1
Kindle_Store,B006LAX8K2,This is a decent plane crash survival story with nice characterizations and story line. It also has an awful lot of grammar and run on errors though. Also at the end several pages are repeated which was irritating. I realize the $1.99 price wasn't very high but I've read a number of free or .99 cent Kindle books with fewer problems. Still I don't regret the purchase or time spent reading it because of the C-124 and description of where and how the actual crash took place. What I would like to see this author do is clean up and lengthen this book just a bit as it has so much to offer.,113,2

Kindle_Store,B006LAX8K2,"Like a previous reviewer, I thought this was non fiction. It didn't take long for that to be apparent. Regardless of the grammatical errors, this might have been a good tale. However, it was written like a boy scout expedition. After burying the dead, the survivors carry on like a bunch of pals on a lengthy outdoor trip. No further concern of the dead, or mention of all families not knowing of their status. Also, the notion that the US Air Force would give up a search after 30 days is pure nonsense.

Bottom line....a bit deceiving not knowing this is fiction up front, and a weak, weak story line...Pollyannaish at best.",112,10

CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"Okay, I have to admit that I still have a soft spot for the first Involver album - I mean, I could put ""Watching Cars Go By"" on repeat for five hours straight and never once get tired of it.  But I'll also say that Invol2ver is really growing on me as well.  I found the Ladytron track to be rather grating at first, but now it's one of my favorite tracks (my top honors would probably go to ""3 Little Piggys"" by the Man himself).  Be sure to try it out with the headphones; there's lots of little electronic nuances that get lost when you just try to listen to it in the car or on your computer.

Yet another genius album.  I love Sasha.",126,0

GREAT ALBUM!!!!!  ON PAR WITH DIGWEED'S TRANSITIONS SERIES !!!!!!",23,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"Invol2ver - What a unique blend of trance music.  I happened to really like this cd.  DJ Sasha certainly uses his craft in the mixing of a interesting blend of ambient, machine, and human aspects into this music.  The tracks flow quite nicely into each other, creating a nice even flow of anticipation, and excitement.  None of the music presented here is practically hard hitting, but gives the listener more of a open spacey feel.  There is certainly nothing is wrong with that!  I rate it four stars.",88,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"Where can I begin?  Wow. The first Involver blew me away but this one came back and shredded me into pieces.  The effects layed out over this CD are the trippiest I've ever heard and everything from the effects, the songs, the light use of the vocals, to the melodies works and blends perfectly well with each other. You can hear he has gotten to be the master of his equipment. Everything is perfectly tight! This CD has so much depth, your attachment to it grows more and more you listen.
Highly recommended, esp if you are into listening to music while in an altered state (but not required).
His other best works: Xpander EP, Airdrawndagger, Involver, New Emissions of Light and Sound (sdtk).  He is a genuis.",128,3

CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"Just ordered it, and I've been listening to it quite a bit since it arrived.  I especially like the track ""3 Little Piggys.""  On my first listen, I thought disc one as a whole was decent, but had certain highlights.  In listening to it again all the way through the next day, I like it even more.  Very immersive.

Once I'm done with disc one, I'm usually still wanting more...so it's nice that this is a two-CD set, and I can just roll into disc two without stopping!",88,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"Here comes another great album by Sasha. This one feels like a mix of Fundacion and Involver. It has the distorted sound and the James-Holden-like feeling from Fundacion and the amazing vocals like those in Involver.
The CD starts off strong with a nice vocal and beat, then it gets a little uneventful, then picks it up again with Arcadia and continues on to Destroy everything you touched(which is the probably the best song on the CD), and finishes strong with a nice vocal.
This album definitely stands out from the junks that most DJ's put out these days. This album will be loved by those who enjoy Fundacion and/or Involver. But is it better than the all time favorite and classic Airdrawndagger? No it is not.",127,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"Sasha has never disappointed me in the past and here, he honors that legacy.

You'll be flown through incredible waves of mind-altering, ear-riveting rhythms. Either on the road or with quality headphones, prepare to be aurally enthralled.

BUY THIS!",39,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"A true letdown from the original Involver! Nothing jives in this new CD. Don't get me wrong, Sasha rocks, but there is much work to be done here. Sorry! The ladder part of the CD starts coming together and you start to feel... and then it ends making you want more. Cheers!",52,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,"a nice rebuttal to John Digweed and his Transitions series...Sasha weaves his signature atmospherics and mixing expertise into a collage of creative soundscapes amid driving beats...

...his latest production exudes a more vocal touch than previous work but he strikes a nice balance while keeping things nice and taut...overall it's par for the course for Sasha and his continued innovation keeps him one of the most interesting and relevant Dj/artist worldwide...

...i put Involver 2 next to Airdrawndagger, in as far as creativity and conceputal production is concerned...His Ibiza GU set is still his best but it was much less innovation as opposed to masterful track selection and mixing...

...Involver 2 keeps him moving forward and even those less enamored with his skill or creativity will be able to appreciate what he's accomplished with his current outing...he's still in the height of his powers here and the small pittance required to enjoy his current work is well worth it...a keeper.",160,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,I've been waitin for this cd for 4 years now and it was worth the wait.  It starts off a lot like the first with the beat around 124bpm or so and picks up through the cd.  This is every bit as good as the first and may be some what better.  Its deep thick bass lines and moody melodies is what u would expect from Sasha (and the help from Charlie May).  If you r a fan of Sasha or just good forward thinking progressive then you should pick this cd up right away.,95,11

Great mixing of the tracks as few can do.  One of the best CDs out this year AND BEST YET... it's tracks that you'll only find on this CD vs. hearing on other compilations.  Very original work.

For perspective I also enjoy Markus Schulz, Gabriel & Dresden, Above & Beyond, Cosmic Gate, Tiesto, Andrew Bennett, Sander Van Doorn, etc.",89,12

CDs_and_Vinyl,B001BP4UEA,I've always argued that Sasha and John Digweed are the cream of the crop. And they usually are. But these other reviewers are crazy. This Involver 2 was a letdown. It was just average. The first 2 tracks from Involver 1 blow away this whole disc by themselves.,48,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,I must leave my mark and say THIS RECORD IS A MODERN POP MASTERPIECE.  I love OMD but never knew this whole recording.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"I have owned this album since it came out in 1991. And I just recently re-discovered it the other day after finding it the other day under a bunch of car parts. One of the GREATEST things about this album is that it does not have a bad track. As someone else here has said, these songs will take you to another world. The faster songs will literally do so at the speed of light (no pun intended). Be careful here, as this CD certainly helped to place alot of my money in the hands of the California Highway Patrol back in the day. And even the slower songs are interesting and inspiring rather than dull and boring. Now it might be nice if I could tell you something nice and wishy-washy about emotions conveyed in these songs. But as with any CD, this is a little above the head of a typical gearhead. Even a new-wave loving gearhead such as myself (Are there any others on this planet?). All I know is that this is one GREAT CD that I was glad to find once again.",187,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"This cd is so amazingly gorgeous. Every single song is beautiful and achingly dreamy in every possible way. OMD on this cd has a dreamy, innocent sound, lots of haunting instrumental, angelic female voices,  McCluskey's brit-boy voice--all fuses together like a call from heaven.  Pure bliss, esp. the track ""was it something i said"" which is  positively MANDATORY listening for tortured souls. Pained and heartfelt,  this cd hits you like no other omd cd. It is more ""emotional""  than it's others, (except maybe for Liberator)",85,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"Yes that's right it is a masterpiece, and anyone who says something different does not like OMD or this type of music. Andy is the reason OMD is so great. I saw the concert for this album and it was even better live. If you like this type of music then buy it you will not be disappointed, but you will not stop listening to it. Look for a new CD from all of the original members OMD by the end of this year!!!",84,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"This albums ""SUGAR TAX"" was done without the help of Paul Humphreys. Andy McCluskey did it on his own and I have to say, its FANTASTIC. It is one of my favorate OMD albums of all times. ""Pandora's Box"", ""Speed of Light"", ""Call my Name"", and ""Sailing on the Seven Seas"" are breathe taking. The entire album is just awsome. Andy did it and did it with a bang. No one thought that it was possible and that OMD was over after Paul left the band. Andy showed everyone that OMD lives on. I hope that one of these I hear that OMD is reformed and another great album would be on its way. The last album ""UNIVERSAL"" was released in 1996 and its a little hard to get in the US, but its available as import.",137,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"When the two primaries of OMD split, most observers, myself included, expected the result to be disaster. It didn't turn out that way. This is a strong album which harkens back to earlier OMD style while retaining elements of their mature sound. Not the best OMD album, nothing like it, but strong electronic pop nonetheless. For children of the 60's and 70's, you owe it to yourself to get this album if only for the track Appolo XI. I've listened to this song more than 100 times, and it still gives me goose bumps every time I hear it.",99,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"4 or 5 stars?!  Er....don't think so.  The depth, grandeur and innovation of Organisation, Architecture + Morality, Dazzle Ships and Junk Culture are long gone.  This slice of long-playing bland pop is like listening to Pet Shop Boys...without PSB's wit, charm, nerve or edge.  Compare the boring and pretentious instrumental ""Apollo XI"" to The Pacific Age's affecting ""Southern"" for just one example of this sad decline.",66,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"In many ways Sugar Tax represents a return to OMD's roots: majestic melancholy songs, shimmering choral arrangements and an abundance of electronic acrobatics. Sailing The Seven seas is replete with blues piano,  heavy drums, those trademark choirs and a seductive and hypnotic chant.  Apollo XI harks back to Dazzle Ships days (remember Radio Prague?), being  made up of samples from the first moon landing set to a decidedly dynamic  dance beat. The voices of presidents Nixon and Kennedy are used as  effectively as those of Kennedy and Pope John Paul II on Psychic TV's  ""Papal Breakdance"" from 1986. Sweeping strings soothe on Walking  On Air and All That Glitters, while the title track sports a harder edged  lyric (about emotional blackmail), but the real beauty is Was It Something  I Said, a song of initially muted power reaching a  crescendo of invective  that sweeps the listener along to its powerful climax.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,OMD made so much great music it is sad to see them create such boring fluff.  The Kraftwerk cover is the best song by far.  They should have stuck together as a duo and continued to produce music from where they left off.,43,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"Others come close and sure I can probably agree that OMD's best song probably isn't on this album.  But, in terms of consistency and quality, this album is incredible.  As an avid OMD music collector, I can attest that all OMD albums have fillers or other unappealing songs, but this has by far the least. This is a melodic, poetic, romantic, shake your hips, and mood making album....a must have.  You will easily find several songs appealing, I guarantee it!

P.S. it's about the music, not how you naively think all artists should be stuck in their 'innovative' or 'pioneering' stage.  No artist or band has ever done that, so grow up yourself!",113,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"This is one of the most beautiful albums I've bought in a long time.  I admit I'm a newby as far as OMD fans go, but I've long been into other awesome bands of the 80's such as New Order and A-Ha.  This album certainly stands up to some of their best masterpieces.  The first seven songs, especially, will take you away into another world entirely.  Some are fast-paced dance anthems and some are slower-paced ballads but they're all laced with a dreamy romantic aura.  On the negative side I would have to say that Apollo XI interrupts this flow and I don't feel it conforms well with the rest of the album.  However, ""Walk Tall"" and ""Neon Nights"" offer more beauty afterwards.  Overall I think this CD is solid.  I recommend this masterpiece to others who are only just not getting into OMD.  More so than I do the Singles.",151,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000000WI3,"""If You Leave"" from the 1985 Pretty In Pink soundtrack was one of the top 10 most infectious, sing-a-longiest and durable songs of the 1980's, but if that's all you know about OMD, then you got up from the table way too soon.

Powder your wig and pinch your cheeks, 'cause it's time to head back to the dining room for the second course.

This album was released in 1991 but it's 80's music just the same.

The 80's aren't over yet until you've heard the full OMD discography. Whether you prefer the Techno-Dance or melancholy Synth-Pop, you're bound to find several songs that you'll kick yourself for having not added to your collection sooner.

Not only are the 80's not over, they're about to grab you by your chin-hair and slap you stupid.

My personal faves on this album:
1. Was It Something I Said?
2. Speed of Light
3. Pandora's Box
4. Big Town
5. Then You Turn Away

In General:
1. (Forever) Live and Die
2. Dreaming
3. So In Love
4. Souvenir",176,14
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"The very beginning was a little flowery in description which tempted me to quit right there.  I read on in the sample and bought the book.  This has fascinating characters, a wide range of kinds of people and creatures, and lots of action with a little mystery coupled with some romance.  The ending is nicely done so that the tale is wrapped up but there is room for more books with the same characters.  I will read any future books in this series.",83,0
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"I liked the premise of the book and the world it was set in.  However, the main character, Mistral, was very unlikeable. She was rash beyond reason, crazy moody and would have temper tantrums. She didn't even care about the people who raised her.  When she found out her adopted mother had died, even though her adoptive parents were really good to her, she didn't care.  Then she met some guy and after several days, it seemed as if she became a totally different person (though her brat-like qualities were still consistent).  I read the whole book hoping my view of her would change because I liked some of the supporting characters and the plot ideas but when the book ended I knew I would not be reading the sequel.  If Mistrel had been tweaked in varying situations to make her more likeable and less volatile, I think I would have liked the book.  Yet, as it stands, I would not recommend it.",163,1

Then she turns into a weak, sniveling, whiny baby when she...falls in love?  I find it unrealistic that such a tough and fearless girl could change so much...and even if she could, why does she let the guy dictate to her that she must persue the sight?  He keeps telling her to be who and what she wants, which is a warrior, not a seer, but she keeps giving in and lets everyone around her force her to be a seer. Stupid and unbelievable  at best",108,2
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"This book had an interesting story with a longer coming of age plot line than I expected, but still managed to pull it off. My only possible issues were with the main character who I had trouble relating to until a good way into the book, and speed with which the story developed.

Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"This is the first of four or more books.  I enjoyed reading it, but could not get interested in the sequel though I tried several times.  This rough and tumble gal becomes a love struck puppy at the end and never gets over it.",44,5
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"I had a hard time reading through the book due to the inconsistencies on Mistral's experience. On one hand we hear how she is such a great hunter and as any hunter knows is patience and that is one thing she doesn't seem to have. The book is peppered with a lot of whining and temper tantrums thrown in with how inexperienced she is in her role. If I didn't know she was supposed to be older, I would assume she was all of 5 with how her character seemed to evolve. It does get a 3 though for the vivid descriptions of the surroundings. If a second book came out, I know I won't be buying it considering I have to keep skipping over so much of irritations in this book.",132,6
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"the first few paragraphs were hard to read due to punctuation errors, and I never complain about that; but it sets the tone of the book. Right after her adopted parents loving discussion about her future, said child is cold and unfeeling towards them. this theme is repeated, as the teenager refers to her home as a prison and never considers the love they gave her.  As another reviewer said the heroine is a real turnoff.  I also had problems with the collage dorm attitude that the training camp had. all party at the bar after working out all day, sophomore jealousy.  I am barely into this book and just can't force myself to read more.  The plot, if there is one, lost in the endless descriptions of daily life.  If author was trying to recreate a Harry Potter type of interesting school grounds, he or she failed big time.  So tired of the teenager that can do it all.
again, this was a kindle unlimited book and free,  thank goodness!",171,7
Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"I had enough after I read about half of the book. The story simply was not really interesting and neither were characters.
In the end I just didn't care what happens next. I personally felt reading any further would just be a waste of my free time.

The characters don't seem to have any depth, and it's really hard to find the main character likable. She is stubborn and thoughtless, and quite often acts like a spoiled brat. She often gets angry when someone reasons with her, and actually doesn't seem to display any other emotions.

Until of course she get's in love. The love interest thread of the main character seems to me to have been just bluntly inserted like something off a checklist, and the relation further seems incredibly out of character, and incredibly unnatural.

Overall, I don't think will be waiting for any other works in this series.",151,8

Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"too simple characters with little development and a very vague world building.

The main character is also social stupid (if not all-around plain dumb), especially considering she can read (and understand) all feelings in others. It also feels off how the main character turns from unfeeling to obsessed in no time and with a deus ex machina reason.",58,10

Kindle_Store,B00ALAVS46,"Glad I bought the first book before seeing the negative comments. I have really enjoyed this series of books. I'll grant that the main character is brash and offensive but that is the point. Her name is Mistral which essentially means a harsh wind. She is stormy, willful and undisciplined, entirely ruled by her emotions. The series is about her growth. I like the characters and appreciate the world Ms. Jones has created. Fun experience. If it gives an idea of how much i've liked it, I got the fifth book thru KindleUnlimited ($9.95 a month for unlimited qualifying books) but ended up buying it after I read it so I could add it to my permanent library.",118,14

Kindle_Store,B00LNM8X5S,"This was a pretty good read, especially since I picked it up purely for the fact that it had to do with sharks and I haven't read the other books in the series yet. The writing and characterizations are fairly simple, but not what I would call juvenile, so it makes it an easy read. The shark behavior in this book is fairly portrayed, which honestly surprised me because Ive read shark books by so called shark experts that are full of inaccuracies (or just plain silliness), so it was refreshing to see accurate portrayal, especially from someone not in the habit of writing shark books.

One thing that did bug me though was some of the automatic assumptions of guilt based on the hobbies of certain people our fearless PIs investigate. Im not going to say specifics because they would probably spoil the mystery, but I will say there is a difference between profiling and stereotyping, and this was clearly stereotyping (likely based in ignorance).

Despite that, Red Surf was still a nice, easy read and I will likely end up reading the other books in the series.",189,8

Good storyline that kept your attention.  Read this book in a few hours.  Couldn't put it down.  Not predictable at all yet predictable.  I say that because I knew who the killer was based on the beginning of the story so I was not surprised at the ending.  But the book is worth reading.",76,10
Kindle_Store,B00LNM8X5S,"Unbelievable bad. People getting eaten by sharks, but do they close down the beach? Of course not. Leah is a petulant, do nothing person up to the very end.

I was paticularly touched by their personal stories that have driven them to choose healthy and slimmer lifestyles and to write this book.

For every weight loss recommendation given, the authors take the time to explain why and how you can use it - helping you shift any wrong mindset which may be responsible for your weight gain in the first place.

I like Chapter 24 best of all - it gives you the key takeaways to remember which I believe will help anyone stick to their weight loss goals.

Detailed references are also provided for further reading at the end of the book.",129,0

Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,This title is very deceiving.  You have to read through the first 1/3 of the book before the author tells you he is all about juicing.  I have probably tried every other diet but I am definitely not into juicing.,40,2
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"This book starts out pretty raw and honest. And from there gives the down and dirty details as to why we're overweight and unhealthy... most of us live our lives on the CRAP diet: Caffeine, Refined sugars, Alcohol and Processed foods. From there, the author introduces better choices in food, mindset and action to turn your health around. I found a lot of useful information I will be applying.",69,3

Concept of program was good, should not be difficult",23,4
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"This book tackles healthy living and weight loss from different dimensions such as the emotional and mindset angles that I have not come across very often,as well as the more common aspects of weight loss, making it a well rounded book.  It also covers issues such as easy ways of monitoring our food intake (portion control) with the aim of adjusting our food intake to what has been scientifically proven to be healthy.

However, I am especially pleased with the chapters on water (chapter 6) and exercise sessions set out in chapter 20. I have gained a whole lot more from reading these two chapters than I have found anywhere else.  The ideas contained in them are very easy to understand and implement and where there could be a challenge in taking action, the authors have offered tips for overcoming some of the common challenges.

Overall, I feel the book is very well written and contains a wealth of information that I will be looking to incorporate into my existing health and weight loss schedule.  Many thanks to the authors for such a great and beneficial book.",187,5
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"I liked the look of this book as it was aimed at women. On reading it I find that the information within the book is just as important for men.

Not only are the most common issues faced with being overweight covered but things that I would never have associated with being overweight. There is everything I could think of do do with eating and weight control covered within these pages.

The recommended plans are cost effective and do not call for expensive foods or supplements that so many other books on this subject cover.

Everything is covered in an easy to follow and understand way that anyone could follow with no problems at all. I love the way the authors stress that this is not a diet book and that eating is good and not bad for us. As I said earlier everything covered is inexpensive to do, which is what has prevented me following methods in other books.

After reading this book (it is an interesting read just as a book. This could be a layman's text book on nutrition). Getting to 150 must be possible with this book and I will be healthy doing it.",198,6
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"This book explains ""healthy eating"" very well. If you follow the suggestions detailed in the book, you will be healthy. The weight loss is a side effect. That is a very welcome side effect, but longer healthy life is even more important.

I don't usually worry about toxins in my food, but after reading this book, I will be very aware of them. If that is all you get out of this book, you have learned a lesson that needs learning.

The 7 minute workout is a perfect plus. Even I can do this program. I look forward to testing out the program and the exercise program.

Buy this book!!!",110,7
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"It's that time of year when a lot of people start formulating their New Year's Resolutions. Usually losing weight makes that list for a lot of people every year. Well, they should put reading this book at the top of their list. It is a very well researched and well written approach to losing weight, exercising and eating right.

There are so many myths floating around that tout this diet and that diet, it's OK to eat this and not that, and on and on so that it is very confusing. Well this book clears up a lot of those myths. The author clearly knows his subject matter and presents it in an easy to understand manner. My point is that this book, while it outlines a weight loss program, I would call if more of a ""save your life program"".  Great information and highly recommended.",146,8
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"This book was a breath of fresh air.  Many diets on the market are simply not healthy and will have you losing and gaining weight like a yo-yo.  This diet is different, the all natural approach gets your body functioning like its supposed to so that you can live a healthy lifestyle and lose weight naturally.  Not only do they go into detail about what you need to do to lose the weight, they also tell you why the steps  you're taking help you lose weight.

By reading this book you learn more about your body and how it breaks down or doesn't break down food and minerals.  This is vital to losing weight, if you don't know how your body functions, then you cant lose weight in a healthy and effective way.  Sure you can crash diet and lose weight, but you'll still be fatigued and be left feeling unsatisfied.  With this diet, not only will you be losing weight but you'll have more energy and won't be left feeling hungry and unsatisfied.  So, if you're looking for a natural way to lose weight and live a healthy life style this is the book for you.",197,9
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought it would be another one of those fad diet books full of fluff, short on substance and low on useful information.

While this book had the normal advice of such things as ""drink more water"" and ""have an accountability partner,"" I was especially interested in the idea about using salt in an interesting way and the comments about our ""exhaust system."" This really had some new insights and makes me think more about taking single steps to losing weight rather than trying to force things to move too quickly. This is a smart book for women and I am glad to have ordered it",104,12
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"when the author keeps repeating he isn't a doctor, take heed. Sounded like they are trying to kill you with salt in the first page and then start talking about selling you things, but you have to contact them to get info. Not a smart way to lose weight at all. Never finished reading it.",55,13
Kindle_Store,B00AF1CRA0,"I think the aspect I liked the most about this book are the strategies to avoid having to exercise willpower. Let's face it -- lack of willpower is the single factor most likely to put a stop to any good intentions about weight loss.  It's oh so hard to resist that extra portion, or most often in my case, chocolate.

The authors also provide some great information about what constitutes healthy eating -- what you should be eating, as well as what to avoid.

Anyone who follows the advice offered in this book should not only shed a few pounds, but they will end up healthier, which means they'll feel good, and when we feel good, we look good.",119,14

Personally, this album was our first exposure to the group.  We enjoy its mellowness, and the soaring vocals and harmonies.  I am not sure that we would buy many of their other albums since this one has a nice mix of songs that are included on the other CDs.

I read this book not really knowing what it was about.  Well I have to say it was definitely worth the surprise.  It was fun reading a book that I knew nothing about.  This book was filled with fun, suspense, action and a bit of romance.  It was nice to read something though that was not a sex fest.  This book was definitely a young adult paranormal book in my opinion.  The only thing I did not like about this book, well 2 things really, was the main girl character.  She is a bit wimpy in my opinion.  I like a good strong lead female character and while this girl was strong in some ways, she was weak in many others.  It did not take away from the book though.  It just made you want to learn more about the others.  The other thing I did not like was that it ended.  I truly wish there was more to the book.

This book is dark and compelling, so different from Ms. Ford's other books. The story pulled me in and kept my attention from beginning to end. I LOVE the characters and I can tell that a lot of research went into this writing process.

 Adrienne is determined and unafraid to do what she has to do to learn the truth.

Rene is a strong protector and tries to do what is right and good, even with his thug exterior.

Jayden is a happy person kept in the dark about what he is, slightly unwilling to accept things that are until an accident pushes him to accept what cannot be changed.

All are involved in a centuries old curse that must run it's course. A strong storyline with strong characters makes this a must read by Lizzy Ford. Don't miss out on this one!

Very anxious to see what happens next! Well done, Ms. Ford!!!",181,1
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,Arc given for honest review. Absolutely love this a real page turner. The characters and the scenes are absolutely beautiful. Lizzy Ford has done it again. I can't wait to read more in this series of books.,37,2
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"Lizzy once again you proofed why you are one of my fav authors today.
Cursed is soooo good I cannot put it down.
If you watched The Originals or even American Horror Story Coven and you were as hooked as I am then you will love this new
adventure from Lizzy.
I do not give away spoilers I am not even going to tell you about all the players only to READ IT, you will fall in LOVE with it.
Cursed will make your neck hair stand up, you will look over your shoulder and believe me you will stay out of alleys.",103,3
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"I received this ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review. I will admit I had a hard time warming up to this one, but by the fourth chapter, I was interested to see where the story would go. The book was character driven, although, it didn't have too much character development (a fine job of using the tarot reading to clue the readers on the protagonists objectives- well done!). I don't read a lot of voo doo books, but I found the storyline interesting, and the mystery pulled me right in. A bit drawn out in some places, so I rolled my eyes over some of the redundancy, but overall, a great plot. Open ended, so I assume this is the first part of a series, but I was satisfied with the book.",135,4
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,I really enjoyed this story. I found the story line so appealing.  The characters Draw you in and have you hooked from the start. Can not wait for the next book.,31,5
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,It's a different story than I usually like but since I love Lizzy Ford's other books I had to check it out. The writing style is a little different than Lizzy's usual style. I found that I couldn't put it down.,41,6
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,I read this and I thought it was pretty good. It makes me want to read the book 2 already to keep the story going. I love how the characters all tie together and how the mystery unfolds.,38,7
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"I don't usually read much to do with Voodoo but I LOVE Lizzy Ford's books so there was no way I was missing out on this one for that tiny reason. Unsurprisingly it was just as great as all of her other books but completely different at the same time. Even if you somewhat hesitant because of the subject you should still give this a chance, Lizzy is an amazing author and this just goes to prove it. I will definitely be on the look out for the next book in this series.",93,8
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"This is a great start to a new series!  I can't wait for the next book in this series, I was hooked from the beginning, just as I thought I would from a book by Lizzy Ford.",37,9
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,At first just reading the description I thought it would be good but a little bland. I was pleasantly surprised that I could not put this book down. I am anxious for the second book in this series to come out.,41,10
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"New Orleans and Voodoo what more could you need, add a little love and you have an amazing story by Lizzy Ford. I liked the POV from different characters because it is nice to know what else is going on with different characters to understand more of the story. Renee is my favorite character strong, smart and loyal it will be interesting to see how he helps Addy with breaking the curse that Jayden and Addy's family started. I enjoyed reading Cursed and cannot wait to see what happens next hopefully we will not have to wait long for the next installment. Cursed has been moved to my favorite book that lizzy was written.",114,11
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"I read this book as a ARC I really liked the book before and I was wondering if she could change it too make it better and Lizzy Ford did. I think the book is really great and it flows a lot better.

 It is about a girl name Adrienne St Croix and how she is trying to find out what happend to her missing sister. She then finds out that her sister is not what she appears to be and may not be as innocent as she wants to believe she is. Then there is Rene who cares for his brother Jax but is concerned that he may be into dark magic that is way above his head. Then there is the curse.

I am eagerly waiting for the next book.",132,12
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"I loved this book, at first it took me a little while to get used to the talking since they are from the south. But after a little while it just added to it. I'm torn between being glad I read it and being upset. I want to know what happens, but I read it right away and now I have to wait. I absolutely love how her books flow, and this one didn't disappoint!",75,13
Kindle_Store,B00ISWKM6E,"I read the original version of the book and let me tell you, this re-written/edited version is a lot better. The history of the curse and how the voodoo families are connected are laid out in a much better way than the original. It has good flow, the characters are more relatable, and the ending was setup much better for the next book.

I can't even imagine what it would be like for the main characters - I'm not the child of a politician or a tarot-reading follower of voodoo, but Ford develops the characters in a way that makes you live the story with them anyway. You feel bad for Jayden when he feels that he can't do what he wants to do because of this family's political connections. You fear for Adrienne when she realizes that she is connected to this voodoo curse more intimately than she first realizes. You even feel for Rene when he gets stuck in the middle of this centuries old curse by forces outside of his control.

I enjoyed this book and can't wait to read what is next for these characters.",189,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BLH,"this is my thrid copy of this cd, they always seem to get scratched really bad. This album is great, it was Ginuiwine first album out and he did outstanding! From tracks 1-10 is just non-stop jamming. He has great beats, great vocals, and outstanding musical effects to spice it up some. If you like Keith Sweat and R. Kelly then Ginuwine is definately the person that ties in both of their style with his own and he just drop hits. And I have yet to meet a lady that can resist the sound of Ginuwine even if they never heard of him. My props out to ""G"" and the Bachelor, also I have all of Ginuwine's CD's and this one is the best then ""100% G"" is the next best.",131,0

I bought this cd as a bit of a joke, mainly because that bachelor song just kills me, but I'm pretty impressed.  This is a good cd- he has a really soothing voice, the beats are great, and he really is genuine about his music.",59,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BLH,"Ginuwine's first album from 1996 was so hot and sexy!  It had the music, beats and grooves for it.  Pony was funky, but there was a funkiness in the ballads of Tell Me Do U Wanna, that phone song, Lonely Daze, and the breezy Only When Ur Lonely. This was one of Timbaland's first successful albums along with Missy Elliott and Aaliyah's, as his complicated beats dominate this album.  Holler must have been done in one take, because the music is all on point!  I still play that a lot, because that bass kicks [...] on it! I liked Ginuwine's ultra funky remake of Prince's When Doves Cry. Now, when you're remaking a Prince song, you've gotta do it right, and this version kicks some serious [...]  Ginuwine recalls the carnal mentality of Prince's first few albums in the '80s.  This album broke Ginuwine in a big way. I saw him in concert in 2000 and he really tore it up on the stage!  Great dancers as well as strong vocals from G himself!  He has really accomplished a lot in 4 albums, having hits from every one and each one selling very well.  I hope he continues to surprise us with more exciting music!",205,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BLH,"He is 100% on tha real. Ginuwine is the best R&B singer out there him and Sisqo can dance like WOAH but SIsqo cannot and willnot ever be able to cmpare to ginuwine.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BLH,"The Bachelor is without a doubt one of the best R&B albums of the last decade. With futuristic beats (provided by Timbaland who can almost do no wrong) and lyrics to match, this was a debut to end all debuts.  I really can't say anything bad about this album... so I won't.
Best tracks (to me) include:
4. Holler
6. Lonely Daze
8. Only When Ur Lonely
9. I'll Do Anything/I'm Sorry (best track on the album)

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"I have been a PT fan for some years now having downloaded/purchased most of their albums as well as their live concerts.  Their work has always held inspiration...the thing about taking things to the edge is that you do not always hit what is popular and trendy.  It seems to me that these guys have been marginal but their musical experimentations are starting to pay off with stuff that as one reviewer put it, that when you listen to it, you need someone to ""peel you off the wall"".  It is simply wild, gorgeous, dynamic, interesting, moving, and at times incredibly inspired.  The title track, Deadwing, knocked me on my glutes...I simply did not expect it given the rather quiet opening.  Arriving somewhere is complex and beautiful.

I don't know...i read these reviews sometimes and reviewers can be all over the map...but the reviews here all seem to give pretty high marks!!! ... if you like to rock, and you have never heard PT before, just DO IT!!!!!",168,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,As good as they say if your into the Tree!,10,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"I can't stop listening to this cd. I recommend buying it. I payed $15 for Deadwing at the concert, I wish i had bought it at amazon. I had known about PT for about a year & i saw they were coming to Illinois, well I saw Porcupine Tree live at the Park West on May 28th in Chicago & it was really cool to say the least. At times i am reminded of other progrock bands. I love that they have mixed heavy modern riffs with beautiful clean acoustic melodies within the same song. I'm not a reviewer, really just a fan & musician. I have listened to this cd 3 or 4 times everyday since the concert & loved every minute. I recently purchased In Absentia & Signify & am looking forward to giving them a listen. Even if you aren't a progrock fan you'll like this band.",150,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"Yet once again this band has dazzled me with their brilliance! I'm glad I waited a while to review this, because at first I didn't THINK I liked it as well as In Absentia. But it didn't take long for all these numbers to get their hooks in me. I love the way Steven Wilson bares his soul on the songs he writes, something that is almost non- existent in this modern-day, mass- manufactured songwriting world. It's like an invitation into his private experiences and I, for one, am glad I accepted. It's easy to see that Steven is an eclectic music fan. I hear so many different influences here: Led Zep, King Crimson (which is further enhanced by a guest appearance by Adrian Belew,) Radiohead, et all... But the thing I like with this recording is that it is another evolutional step from the last, and that's what I define as ""progressive."" There are moments of their ""Floyd- era"" period interspersed with high- voltage rock which really works for me. It's hard to understand how songs with mainly melancholic lyrics can always seem to lift my spirits. Am I ""growing stranger by the minute?"" This is a MUST HAVE!",200,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"I was in high school when Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, Yes, etc. were in their prime (I'm just over 50). This group ranks right up there as musicians and with their vision of what a complete ""album"" should be like. It took a couple listens to fully enjoy this epic CD. Now I can't get it out of my CD player. PT gives hope for new rock music, they are superb! Check out their album ""In Absentia"" it's just as good, slightly less ""hard"". Someone told me that Classic Rock magazine named Deadwing the best new CD in 2005. Not sure if that's true, but they get my vote! Play the song - Arriving Somewhere But Not Here - a few times - Loud! You'll get hooked!",127,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"Everyone should know the great music this band has made.  Unfortunately, American radio plays crap and they play it over and over and over.  It's too bad corporations control every aspect of our lives, what we see, what we hear, what we read, etc.  Do yourself a favor and go outside the box a little and find some magic...like Porcupine Tree.",61,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"I have most of the PT albums now (finally), also some of Steve Wilson's Blackfield and No-man work.  Music preferences are subjective to the individual, but there are common threads.  I have a sizeable collection spanning everything from Ace of Base to Zero 7.  I have most of Pink Floyd's work, Roger Waters and David Gilmour's work, as well as Dream Theater and Queensryche, etc.  I know you don't really care about what I collect, but I wanted to share a reference point. When I listen to rock (which is more often than not), I try to listed to the aforementioned artists and groups. Pink Floyd, especially will always be my favorite ""head"" music. PT's Deadwing plants itself very well in the rock part of my collection. The music is layered, complex and very well written. The title track, Deadwing, is an instant hit.  While the 3rd track, Lazarus, demonstrates Steve Wilson's vocals and the group's ability to produce a beautiful melody. Arriving Somewhere But Not Here, is the jewel of the album. This entire 12+ minute track may very well intoxicate you. The simple guitar repetition, vocals and acoustics are the best I've heard in years. Enjoy!",198,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"This recording is definately the most advanced recording of anything available on the planet at this time. Porcupine Tree has even moved a step ahead of King Crimson ( a remarkable feat in itself) with this recording. After listening to this I can really understand how fitting it is to have Robert Fripp opening some of the shows for the band on this tour. I agree that Steve Wilson has become a musical genius (as Fripp is) as he is making the most advanced, well - written, original work of any artist out there. This CD has incredible depth, beauty, and insight into the times we live in - AND IT ROCKS HARD! Also check out Blackfield, Opeth, and No-Man (all with Steve Wilson). Porcupine Tree have risen above The Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Dream Theater and all of the other New Progressive Rock Bands of the new century! I truly believe that this CD will be a classic for years to come. This one is going to be hard to top and anyone who does not have this in their collection does not know music. Period. A Billion star rating!",191,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"Why aren't these guys on the radio? Well, I'm doing my part. This past Christmas all my presents included either ""In Absentia"" or ""Deadwing"". The selection as to who got which album was purely random simply because both albums are superb. Everyone, absolutely everyone who got this a part of their gift loved it and bought the counterpart.

Quite possibly some of the finest mixed and mastered material ever available makes it an even better treat. Wilson is some kind of genius with his use of light versus dark. And now with the release of ""Blank Planet"" this completes just an amazing trilogy of albums that are constantly playing back-to-back-to-back in my car, home stereo, and computer.",117,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"At the risk of spouting nothing but hyperbole, I can honestly say that this album is flawless.  A masterpiece.  The best cd of 2005.  One of the best ever.  Yes, it really is that good.

With ""Deadwing,"" Porcupine Tree managed to combine their newer slightly metallic sound with their pop sensibilities and their lush atmospheric side, ala their earlier material like ""Up the Downstair"" and ""Signify.""

As always, the production is tremendous.  Every instrument is very clear and there is a perfect amount of separation so the music has plenty of room to breathe and draw the listener in.  I don't think I've ever heard a better drum sound that the one producer/songwriter/guitarist/vocalist/musical extraordinaire Steven Wilson achieved on the song Halo.

This is, in my estimation, the fourth consecutive five star-album Porcupine Tree has released and they are showing no signs of letting up.  One would think that after gems like ""Stupid Dream,"" ""Lightbulb Sun"" and ""In Absentia,"" they would be running out of ideas, but they managed to top themselves once again.",173,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"I can't write a proper review or we'd have a novel on our hands.  I'll simply say: this album changed my life and I will continue coming back to it for the rest of my days.  Granted, the same goes for just about every other Porcupine Tree album, as well as Steven Wilson's other work.  If you do not own this album, the time has come.",66,12

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0007TX894,"I heard about PT from a co-worker and at the time did not pay close enough attention.  It was several years later I remembered that strange band name and checked out a few of the band's tracks.  Wow, I wish I paid attention sooner.  Like other reviewers I started to buy up the entire catalog.  Most people just have not heard of PT because of the poor selection of music played by radio stations but the word of mouth is growing.  The band has not had an album for several years now but I suspect their next release if/when that ever occurs would be a huge hit in the US.

Deadwing is a great example of the band's talent.  Every player is well represented on their albums.  The drums, the bass, the keyboards.  I know it's obvious to mention Steve Wilson but his band mates are just as incredible.  I think that's why so many like to hear Mr. Wilson with PT.

If you are on the fence about this band check out Mellotron Scratch and if not sure if they rock out enough for you check out Anethsitize from Fear of the Black Planet.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000B9EYK2,Great DVD!!  I saw the Tornadoes live and this is every bit as good if not better.  It's a wonderful tribute to Doug Sahm and Freddy Fender.  Doug's showmanship and interaction with bandmembers and the audience make this one of the better CMT DVDs that I own.  Freddy Fender was as soulful in this show as when he was 30 years younger.

From his west side San Antonio roots the conjunto/norteno influence is pure South Texas Rock, the British Invasion propelled Doug into the limelight with his Sir Douglas Quintet with a side trip to San Francisco psychedelia. Of course Doug's Texas Road House Blues performances at Antone's are historic.  But Doug brings it all home with the Tornadoes!!!  If you're not familiar with the Tornadoes listen to their title cut from the album ""4 Aces"", it's all there; the story, the music, and the lives of these unique individual Texans who each  brought their cards to the table and made musical magic.

San Antonio is rich in history and culture and this performance on Austin City Limits conveys the magic of the Texas Hill Country.  The Hispanic and German and Czech influences, the magic of the Lone Star shines on all these gentlemen and their individual as well as combined talents.

This is a must have for any true Texan!!!",205,6

I really didn't realize that Freddie Fender was such a competent guitarist.  Why didn't I know that?  Doug Sahm and Augie Meyers were at the top of their game here (they were always at the top of their game and I suppose Augie still is).  Flaco is the greatest.  All the other musicians that played on this were fabulous.  Derek O'Brien even shows up for a couple of songs.  I wish more stuff on DVD by Doug Sahm would come out.  He was such a Superkool Kat.  Doug seemed irritated at a couple of things going on behind the stage during parts of the show (some screw ups going on back there, which seems rare enough for Austin City Limits) but other than that, Sahm was just really kicking it out during this show.  A few times he REALLY opens up on the guitar and even went out in the dancing audience while jamming out bigtime.",176,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000B9EYK2,"What an enjoyable DVD! The group is in fine form in another wonderful Austin City Limits production. It is a shame such a talented artist as Doug Sahm passed away suddenly at 58 years of age (Sahm died November 18th, 1999). The song list is outstanding in this October 16th, 1990 show. I'm a big fan of the individual members past hit standards (i.e.: ""She's About A Mover"", ""Mendicino"", ""Before The Next Tear Drop Falls"") but found myself truly enjoying ""Dinero"", ""(Hey Baby) Que Paso"" and the rockin' ""Adios Amigos"". If this genre of music is what you enjoy then you will not be disappointed. I was not a fan of this style till I discovered these guys years ago.

Also, the bonus footage is great with the Christmas encores.  Alot of fun!!!",81,1

CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"This is a nice little surprise! Fans will enjoy all of it, the rest will enjoy most of it! The Boys like to throw out surprise selections in their shows, and they did a couple here too. In all fairness, Neil's voice may not sound studio perfect, but live performances are very hard to do flawlesly without using loud background singers or echo effects to compensate live performance difficulties. They have used little of that here,and Neil has essentially laid his sweet little voice out naked for us on this effort. I think it's absolutely fabulous!",96,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"The video and audio in this DVD is excellent, it exceeded my expectations. the dynamics and detail are superb, video is clear free of artifacts. The concert's music is very nice all songs are top notch, and you do get extra taste of the Pet Shop Boys ability to improve any song they get.
The only negative is the DVD box itself, is not good quality is flimsy ease to break. Comes boxed like a CD.",76,4

Highly recommend!",59,7

Just wish the boys had more hits over here in the states than they have.",71,8

records sales are just barely, below (by the Numbers): Madonna, Donna Summer,
Janet Jackson, then PSB! You just can't ignore their raw-talent!",101,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B0034WYVSI,"This new live concert Pandemonium is a strong come back for the Pet Shop Boys. Their best live concert performances since 1994 when they did the Discovery Tour. Brilliant, lively, and they brought back some old songs that although not well known, nor commercial, are seminal in their discography, Do I have To?, Kings Cross, Two divided by Zero, all from the early days, are brilliant masterpieces that only hard core fans will recognize. Very glad to see that they skipped songs from their dark ages, from the 2002 'Release' that made me believe that the Pet Shop Boys were on the path to oblivion with that awful recording.

Back with full force and an amazing audiovisual show which is their trademark.
This is a concert cd that you should definitely add to your collection if you don't have any live performance CD and DVD yet, if you already have the others, Concrete, Live at Savoy, etc... this one will surprise you.

This is an instant classic, and a demonstration of why they were awarded the Brit awards to their contribution in music over the last 25 years.",188,13

Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,I like this book.  The male protagonist was a man who knew what he wanted and knew how to get it.  I like how it wasn't those cliche alphas that mostly cared about himself.  Drake's emotion felt genuine.  Rachel was a decent heroine but I just felt like Drake dominated the novel.  It was a quick romance.  Wish it was longer but it was good.,65,2

I did felt the two main characters Rachel and Drake were missing something and I couldn't connect with the characters. I felt Rachel was younger than her twenties, and not over 21. Drake was an alpha male, and knew he wanted Rachel as his wife, when he first saw her. I can't really say I enjoyed the book as much as her other books, but I give her credit for trying a new genre.",88,9

You have Drake, the alpha guy what wants the sweet Rachel as his woman and will stop at nothing to get her. Then you have the virgin Rachel, who is trying to rebuild herself after a bad breakup in the city. Together, they show a sweeter side of a love that is worth fighting for. Also, because this is a book by Sam Crescent, it is very very hot! Enjoy!!",91,10

Rachael was hurt in the past by her ex-boyfriend and did not want to trust her feelings towards Drake, who she thought was nothing more than a womanizer. Once she let her walls down and saw Drake as the man he really was they fell in love in built a life together.  Drake gave Rachael the moon sun and stars.  I really enjoyed this book.",100,12
Kindle_Store,B00L1YQOTA,Overall a good story however I felt that the book lost some of it's charm with the bad language and the very unromance words during their love sence.  I enjoyed reading about strong women and men and great passion sexual action. The love sence were more like sex without any emotional connection.,52,13

Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"This beautiful and poetic story is one of the best novels I've read in a long time.  Since the book was originally written in Arabic it doesn't read as an Iraqi author writing for foreigners, and this makes the story seem more intimate and real.  Sinan Antoon eloquently portrays the immense tragedies that Iraqis have faced over the years through an individual story about a failed artist, and while the story conveys a deep sadness, it is also multidimensional and will leave you thinking about many different ideas/images/stories. Readers who have some understanding of Iraq's history might appreciate the book more, but I think it should seem accessible for anyone.  I read it right after Fiasco: the American Military Adventure in Iraq, which is a powerful combination/sequence if your aim is to read more about Iraq generally.  I do wish that the publisher had allowed Sinan Antoon to keep the original Arabic title, ""The Pomegranate Alone,"" but other than that, this book is near perfect.",165,3

It can be a dark book at times and very descriptive, but Sinan has such a powerful imagination that he makes every chapter vivid and puts pictures into your mind. I also had the chance to Skype with the author Sinan Antoon, asking him all kinds of questions about his book. This book will not disappoint, I guarantee. The main character helps you understand what it is like to be surrounded by death in a militarized and civil war area.
This book is fantastic.",104,5

Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,I absolutely loved this novel.  I read it about 3 times for the same class.  We discussed trauma and oppression and this was one of the books on our list that semester and I completely devoured it in one sitting.  Needless to say it was what I used to write all  my reports on and it continues to be one of the best books I've read in quite a while.  Antoon uses beautiful metaphors to bring us into the world of Jawad and his family.  To think that Antoon spent 4 years total (between writing and then translating) in the world of Jawad is amazing to me.  He did an amazing job of capturing this snapshot of time.,118,9

Reading and absorbing the main character in this novel Jawad or Jodi"" let me think,  and to believing this story is not fiction, I felt him, lived his questions, transformed myself to this character, and after I finished the reading, I was naked again, felt of huge emptiness, indeed I just want to go back between the words to find myself, yes it is sorrow, fear, and pain but whenever I read any chapter, I feel I am standing next to Jodi, as his close friend that he will never die and will never leave him alone!
This novel, the corpse washer is a must to read, if you want to see Iraq and get the picture from another corner, this novel will help you, and it is highly recommended!",193,11
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"I recently read this book wondering if it would be appropriate for my ninth grade students, and while I would not choose it for them, I loved the book myself. I found it engaging throughout the entire read. It grabbed my attention right from the beginning and didn't let go. It provides a realistic portrayal of life in Iraq during this time period. One thing about The Corpse Washer I came to enjoy was how the main narrative is interrupted with brief memories or vignettes from the past. To me it gave the book a true sense of realism. I can only imagine that Iraqis trying to survive this time period spent quite a lot of time reflecting on the past. The vignettes gave the book a disorienting feeling, which again must have been the way that many Iraqis felt. I highly recommend this book, in fact I've already purchased another book by Sinan Antoon, I'jaam: an Iraqi Rhapsody, and I can't wait to start it",166,12
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,Interesting characters and story of Iraqi life during the dysphoria.  Beautiful writing comes across in this translation of literary work by the author.,23,13
Kindle_Store,B00DV6OHSG,"This book was originally written in Arabic, but then translated by the author, into English. According to members of our book group who speak both languages, the content was slightly adjusted to accommodate the different audience.

Most of my book group enjoyed this more than I did, but then, one of my pet hates is recollection of dreams in novels, and there is a lot of that here. My other quibble was that I found the narrative a bit stilted in places.

On the plus side, this book provides an insider's view into life in Iraq from the relative peace of the 1960s until current times. Jawad is attending university in the late 1980s, training to become an artist, against his father's wishes. He has considerable talent, but has to abandon his dreams when he needs to take over his father's business, washing the dead of the Sunni religion. As the Iraqi wars intensify and the bodies start building up he becomes more and more depressed by his situation.

This is not a cheerful novel, but it is an excellent insight into life in Iraq and is a easier to read than a lot of Arabic novels in translation.",199,14

There's not one cut where you want to hit the 'Skip' button on your player for this is Sinatra at his finest. Some of his latter recordings were released when he voice was beginning to falter...sometimes, almost screaming with little vibrato and a scratchy voice. These recordings are when he was at his peak on Capitol...some up-tempo, some lush ballads, but all are wonderfully performed. This is one of those collections of 'remember when'...where one's deja vu recalls a certain event in one's life, a friend or loved one you were with when you first heard it...in other words hundreds and thousands of good memories created by the master.",134,0

All of Frank's Capitol-era work is excellent, the best of his career. Which means you can't go wrong with any comp from Capitol. The inclusion of If You Are But a Dream has lifelong Sinatra collectors (like me) dancing in the aisles over this release.

Still, I can't award 5 stars, since those should be reserved for the best, and that would be any of his concept albums from the 1950s.",95,4

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KP62HK,"I like the combination of the songs on this disc.  Really, how could you go wrong with what's on here?  I think the sound remastering on this disc is a step up from previous Sinatra releases over the past 10 years, although it's still not quite what it could be.  Although its asking too much these days, I'll have to side with the great Steve Hoffman (mastering guru) in what to do with remastering original source material like this: ""Find a good musical tape playback system, send the signal to digital and `get out of the way!""

By the way, to answer the question of a previous reviewer, the version of ""If You Are But A Dream"" is in mono here. Highly recommended.",123,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000KP62HK,"I am a huge Sinatra fan, and while these are all great songs, i would still prefer to hear them in their original album format.  The flow is more smooth from track to track.  And if i had to choose only one CD, i would still pick Songs For Swingin' Lovers or Swingin' Affair over this compilation.  About half the songs on this CD come from those two albums anyway.

Still, there are worse compilations.  At least this is SOMEWHAT thematically similar.  If you really just want a sort of best of the 50's Sinatra, this is probably it.  But remember, while they ARE all love songs, they are NOT all ballads.  They range from intimate ballads to gentle swingers to somewhat hard swingers.  This isn't a cozy-up-to-the-fire late night listening love songs CD.  For that, go for Nice and Easy or Wee Small Hours....Sinatra's two best albums of love songs.",151,10

Kindle_Store,B004USP1AW,"If you like your urban fantasy with sharp wit, a fun cast of characters (both undead and live) and fantastic battle/fight scenes, read S.K.S. Perry's DARKSIDE. Despite the not-alive nature of its protagonist, though, this book and its sequel both have a lot of heart.",45,3
Kindle_Store,B004USP1AW,"Darkside isn't that dark, really. In fact, the novel, if not exactly light, is quite witty, fast-paced, and seriously genre-bending. The story is about a guy named James Decker who dies in the process of saving a young woman from being attacked. But he finds that he really isn't dead...well, sort of.

From the blurb:
Haunted by the ghosts of his father and grandfather, [James Decker] learns that the woman he rescued is in fact an Innocent, the physical embodiment of hope. As it turns out, seeing dead people is the least of James' worries. It's the trolls, goblins, vampires, and other assorted creepy-crawlies that make being dead a living nightmare.

Turns out Darkside is what all these dark creatures living in the Otherworld call our reality. And that's just one of the rules of the afterlife James has to learn as he finds a new lease on life protecting the Innocent from further harm. With wry humor and snide first person remarks, Perry transports you from one realm to the other and back again in a quest you'll not likely forget - if you don't die laughing first. A bit slow in the middle, but overall, a solid debut novel.",201,4

Overall Feedback: Perry delivers and absolutely hilarious paranormal/urban fantasy/adventure all rolled into one. This is a non stop page-turning, rip-roaring adventure that begs for your attention and takes you into the perfect fantasy.  Go ahead and take the chance.  No regrets here I promise.

Point of View:  Perry does great with showing you the world he created from Decker's side.

Voice:  The humor is what will keep you going.  The paranormal will keep you thinking.  The adventure will stop your breathing.

Character Development: Spot on as you wander/adventure through half death (my words) with Decker.

Plot: Perry paints a world that you know has to exist.  Or at least like to believe it exists.

Dialogue: Top notch and flowing.  Really adds to the storyline and character development.

Pacing: Non stop, heart pumping and amazing.

Setting:  Perry does very well to describe a place no one has been but able to make it a reality in our minds and make it seem familiar.

Continuity:  Perry is obvious in wanting this to be a series (my opinion) but he gives enough to make this stand on it's own.

Kindle_Store,B004USP1AW,"This book is probably the best book that no one has ever heard of.  I have read it at least 5 times, along with the second book in the series, Darkside: Waking the Dead.  In fact, I liked this book so much, I wrote the author, something I never do, because why would the author care what I think??  But we had an email exchange that I have kept.  What a great guy!!  But back to the book...
Hilarious!  Witty!  Frightening!  One of a kind!  The concept of becoming immortal or dead, and then to go on living as a type of regular guy hero is just fascinating to me.  The style with which it is written is beyond anything I have read prior to this or after.  In fact, I just keep crossing my fingers that Mr. Perry will keep the series going.
If you are bored with sci fi, fantasy, and vampires all in their same formats - then put them all together in a witty, wacky, crazy, intelligent way with this book.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.  Enjoy the ride!!!",187,13
Kindle_Store,B004USP1AW,"DARKSIDE by SKS Perry is a wonderful book. Perry has written a bright and funny fantasy, full of sharp witty dialogue and characters I found likeable and endearing. This book has heart and deserves a much wider audience.

Rarely has a book made me laugh so much and care about the characters as deeply as DARKSIDE. Buy this book and then go buy the sequel.

Kindle_Store,B005BYS48K,"To say the least, I was sorely disappointed after starting this book. The short synopsis intrigued me, and I was pretty excited about reading it. Unfortunately, I couldn't even stomach being able to finish it. I don't mean to be the grammar police, and I can definitely enjoy a book that has a few grammatical areas. Key word being FEW. I'm only 14 and I feel like I could have written this book so much better! I just couldn't even read it through, it was that unbearable! When you read a paragraph and have to think a while just to realize what the author's trying to say, that's not a good read. It was a great idea, I just don't think it was written correctly. AT ALL!):",127,2

Kindle_Store,B005BYS48K,This book was okay but it was not long enough I would have LOVES it if it was longer like all the other books I read and if I say it is just ok well that says something cause I LOVE books and I love almost ALL books so unless you need a QUICK (and I mean quick like it took me 15 minutes to read this book) read don't get this book if you rarely read than DO NOT get this book. To the people who need suggestions on books than I would suggest Falling by,97,7
Kindle_Store,B005BYS48K,this book grabbed my attention and once I bought it and started reading I loved it. But one thing I really dislike is that it ended very suddenly! I was reading and then I was anxious to get to the next part and then I realized that this was the end of the book...I could understand ending the book abruptly if it had a second book but this book doesn't and that threw me off. But over all good book but it leaves you wondering and wanting more at the end.,91,8
Kindle_Store,B005BYS48K,"Read this during a train ride and it was enjoyable and a decent read. After reading it I was wanted more and had some unanswered questions but nothing to take away from the enjoyment of the story and I really thought the plot was interesting, quirky and fun.",48,9
Kindle_Store,B005BYS48K,"I didn't like this book i sped though it in an hour and a half, granted I read faster than most of my friends but still, an average book takes me a day at least to finish.

Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,An enjoyable read. I am planning to buy the next in the series. Developed characters and a slice of New Zealand life.,22,0
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,I'm loving this series and Ready To Burn delivers all the sass and sizzle and humour of the first two books. Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and a few tear-jerking ones too. Ms Alvarez has crafted a cast of characters you can't help falling in love with and will want to revisit with each new book. And the Christmas novella (Christmas With You) is a great follow-up read. I can't wait for book number five!,74,1
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"Another great story by Tracey Alvarez. My favorite part about these books is the character development, especially of the hero. At the beginning, I wasn't fond of Del Westlake, and I wondered how the author is going to turn him around. By about halfway, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, by the end, I'd marry him. Del Westlake has a lot on his plate (pun intended) and he has to learn to accept help before he can truly be worthy of our heroine.

A wonderful read although if I'm honest, it could do with a few less swearwords. (Purchased on Amazon Canada, reviewed here for greater exposure.)",111,2
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"This book was an enjoyable, fun, romance novel.  I would highly recommend this book and others in the series.  Its a quick read and a pick me up.",28,3

Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"I received a few copy of this book in exchange for a honest review.  Loved this book; it is about Del a famous chef who made it big in LA who screwed up and comes home to New Zealand to help run his family place because his das who he has not spoken too is sick.  Del has a lot of baggage that he needs to sort out.  At his dad's place Shayne has been helping run the restraunt hoping he would eventually be made head chef.  SPARKS and daggers fly love and  a wedding happen  along with a 9,000 mile separation between Del and Shayne.  I was able to enjoy the story without reading the first two. Enjoy",119,5
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"So glad to get to Shaye's story. She and Del are great together. I would have liked to read a little more about West and Piper's wedding and not sure why they all get engaged so quickly, but I really like this series.",43,6
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,Another winner! Del and Shaye are so much fun - and the book had me smiling and laughing a lot. The twists and turns pulled me in and I had a hard time putting it down to deal with Real Life. A great read!,44,7
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,I had to love this witty romance because the characters were so real.  Lots of snarky wit and arrogance covering self confidence issues as they both try not to give in to the attraction.  I received the book free in return for an honest review.,45,8
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"Tracey Alvarez managed to take me to Stewart Island once again. I loved the banter and friction between the two main characters. As with the first two, this book is filled with plenty of hilarious one liners that had me chuckling well into the night. Well done Tracey.",48,9
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"This is book three in the Due South series and each one is a great story in itself but also builds on the previous books. The women are strong, the men are gorgeous and the story lines are sexy. I highly recommend them. Makes me want to move to New Zealand!",51,10
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"I love how Tracey's couples all have unique relationships. They are all quite real in their flaws and quirks and issues. Family and trust and forgiveness were primary elements in this story, as they were in her first 2. The chemistry between them was hot but they had a cute playful side too that I liked a lot. And I felt like I could relate to Shaye a bit more than to Piper or Kezia but, while he was a good match for Shaye, I wasn't as keen on Del as I was on West and Ben. But I will definitely be going on to book 4! I want to live in Oban!",113,11
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"Two opinionated chefs; one kitchen; lots of heat.  Del and Shaye grew up together.  Del's father, Bill, owns the restaurant where Shaye is sous chef.  His brother is about to marry her sister, so Del's arrival back in town isn't unexpected.  Turns out, however, that Del really didn't have any other place to go.  He had been fired from the restaurant in LA with his reputation in shambles.  Bill is in poor health and needs help.  He offers the head chef position to Del, even though they have been estranged for years.  Shaye always thought that job would be hers.  The story is complicated when the restaurant is choosen to be featured in a reality show.  This book was a joy to read.  The situations and dialog are completely believable.  The attraction between Del and Shaye is hot!  The Due South series just keeps getting better..The author provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",159,12
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"This is my favorite among the books I've read in Tracey Alvarez's Due South series.  Ready to Burn has just the right amount of sass, sizzle, and spice to fascinate and reel in readers like me. It is the love story of chefs Del and Shaye set, of course, in the ever beautiful and endearing Stewart Island.  Our two chefs have to work together both on and off camera while dealing with their past, personal issues, and intense attraction.  I love Del and Shaye's passion and chemistry in and out of the kitchen, how they value their families, and how they tried hard to be brave for each other (their love brings them all the way to New York!)
I thought it was cute and refreshing too how Del and Shaye showed restraint at the start and didn't immediately devour or pounce on each other.  It reminded me of stew that is slowly simmering and becoming more flavorful.  Both characters grew on me - the more I read and turned the pages, the more I liked Due South's resident chefs.  Tracey Alvarez sure knows how to cook up and serve the most delicious of romances.  Bravo!",196,13
Kindle_Store,B00NMYIRE2,"I received this book for free in exchange for a honest review.

Before I could read this book I found that it was book three in the series therefore I had to read the others first before I could honestly give my opinion. So glad I did. It's a wonderful series can't wait to read the others got them on my wish list. I love the characters especially their sideline conversation to themselves, loved the dramatics of each character, loved the problem solving of life skills, very creative wording, loved the books!",92,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"While not one of my favorite Miles lp's, his adaptation of ""Porgy and Bess"" nevertheless is soulful, and offers the listeners a different look at Miles- the man who respects the classics and does them justice.
This lp only encapsulates a very small fraction of what Miles davis was, but still, it is a very important cd, showing Miles, while certainly restrained in his playing, comfortable in a big band setting, and blowing.
Great cd.",75,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"The is the first Miles Davis recording I owned. Since then I have become a great appreciator of the works he has compiled.
Listening to Porgy & Bess is almost like listening to the score of a film. Each track projects to your mind's eye the story behind each song. For example, the song ""I Love You Porgy""
paints vividly the cries of a woman being unwillingly torn from her lover. ""The Prayer"" shows the struggle of a person trying desperately to persevere through adversity. The albums highlight and one of the all-time favorite Miles Davis cuts, ""Summertime"" ignites your soul as soon as that first note cuts through your speakers. The album as a whole focuses more on the orchestra element than the jazz(i.e. Miles' trumpet)element. The album is without a centerpiece for a Miles Davis collection.",138,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,If you are a Miles Davis fan then this album is a must have as it is a classic example of his work.,23,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"Look closely to see what is being written about Miles Davis' Porgy & Bess, and see how sometimes words fail us all.  You will find words like:  ""Must-have"", ""best""  superb""  and the like.  But they simply cannot do justice to this fabulous piece of music.
This may be the best collaboration of Davis and Gil Evans.  When you add the gifts that they have shown on their other work to a combination with the Brothers Gershwin, you understandibly come up with something splendid, notwithstanding the fact that Gershwin and Davis could not have been different sociologically as they could have been.
The melodies here are comfortably familiar to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of American music, because they have been done so often by such a diverse group of performers.  However, the minimalist playing of Miles Davis, combined with the musical tapestry created by Evans makes this wonderful music new again.
Hearing the trumpet of Miles Davis in the familiar strains of ""Summertime"" would make both Louis Armstrong and even Gabriel put down their horns and say ""wow"".
No music collection can be considered complete without this epic.",190,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"Beautiful rendition of Porgy & Bess.  I was disappointed that the lyrics were not part of the program, but the music is so fantastic that it's fine as is.",29,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"I write this review as a confessed jazz amateur.
That said, this is some of the most beautiful music I am aware of .
Miles Davis employs a sensativity and subtlty that defy desription.
I would not be the first of his fans to be awed by his almost pervasive minimalism, but I am constantly chilled (in a most positive way) by the startling sound that appears from the black silence he paints.
Samuel Beckett once wrote that ""...every word is a stain on silence and nothingness..."" certainly Davis has taken this thought to heart.
Like a negative contour sketch that highlights the empty space, Davis dances around the silence, telling only enough of a musical story to leave you begging for more.
Whether or not ""Porgy and Bess,"" sounds as Gershwin intended is largely irrelavent, because it sounds very much as Davis intended, and that makes this a fabulous recording.",151,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,This is the best jazz recording of this opera and is probably Miles Davis at his best.,17,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"I adore Miles Davis and also Gil Evans. They have played together very successfully, and the works featuring them together have become classics.  However, I was disappointed with this CD. To play on Miles's ""Kind of Blue,"" I would like to say that this album is ""way too blue"".  It is too slow, too dreamy, very rambling, and sometimes only the ghost of the melody can be heard. It put me to sleep. I was highly disappointed,",77,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,Brilliant album and sound by Miles Davis.  A must addition to my collection.  I love it!,16,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"For my taste, as a fairly casual jazz fan and as someone who prefers the pre-fusion career of Mr. Davis, say, before 1965 or so, ""Porgy and Bess"" is a winner. Not as unrelievably somber as ""Sketches of Spain"" but more consistent in emotion than ""Miles Ahead"" (his other two large-band collaborations with arranger Gil Evans.) I am not crazy about ""Porgy"" as a work of art in its original form, finding it brilliant only in parts. What Miles and Gil have tweaked in the score to fit their improvisational impulses and yet be faithful to the composer's intentions works quite well. This CD version clocks in at just under one hour, and every track is worth a close listen or two (I find earphones help) before one puts it on the changer as background to driving or household tasks. Read six or ten of the earlier reviews to get better data than I can give as to the musicianship. I judge by the standard ""Did I enjoy hearing it? Will I look forward to the next time I get to play it? Do I think it was worth the price I paid?"" The answers to all three are yes, yeah, and of course.",204,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"If you can't have a jazz collection without Kind of Blue, then you certainly can't have a Miles Davis collection without Porgy and Bess.  This is the best arrangement of Porgy and Bess tunes (from the original by my favorite composer Gershwin), and it's also one of my favorite Miles albums.  He wails, and while this whole album has no words, you can get the feeling of each tune and you can tell what they're supposed to be about.
Miles was a genious, and this album is no exception.  I think it's one of the best of his career.",99,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"""KIND OF BLUE"", ""SKETCHES OF SPAIN"", AND ""PORGY & BESS""  ARE MILES DAVIS BEST ALBUM IN THAT ORDER OF 1-2-3...",20,11
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"If you're a Miles fan, or a Gil Evans fan, you have it already. Otherwise, a really good album to have if you want to see what they were doing when collaborating. If you're a Gershwin fan, the situation is a little muddier as it's nothing like the original, but still may be a good introduction to what happens whan hardcore jazz musicians take on something from outside their immediate world, & do it well.",75,12

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000MI1XQK,"In this installment of the classic Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess, Miles makes the the music come alive in a way that he can do.  The music is filled with emotion.  Each note sends you on a journey through the lives of  Porgy and Bess.  It takes you ther in way not many works of music can do.  From the power of Buzzard Sond to the groove of Summertime, this is one of  Miles's best.",75,14

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000395J,"After years of doing their own accompaniment, the Four Freshmen & Five Trombones was the FF's first album with an orchestral backup - as well as arrangements by Pete Rugulo (who arranged many of Stan Kenton's early classics). I loved the album when it was first released on vinyl - in the spring of 1956 - and still love it today. The Freshmen renditions of ""I Remember You"" and ""Angel Eyes"" are the best I've heard by any artist. The album did well and was soon followed by the Five Trumpets album. In that collection ""Goodbye"" mournfully drags along, but snappy versions of ""Easy Street"" and ""Got a Date With an Angel"" add delight and verve to yet another triumph in jazz vocalization.",123,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000395J,"I was so pleased to find this CD. It has some of their best stuff, and I can just close my eyes and drift back to the days when music meant something more substantial than drums and guitars.

I am 65 years old and it's about time that I have stumbled on a group that dates all the way back to 1948.  This CD is fantastic, blending the magical FF voices with additional brass sounds that are truly magical.  I had been downloading FF songs, and love the current group also.

CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000395J,"Discovered by bandleader Stan Kenton in a small midwestern lounge in the fifties, The Four Freshmen became one of the most successful vocal groups in recorded history and these two Capitol recordings from the fifties are the ""Freshmen"" at their best. The ""Five Trombones"", is a marvelous blending of the quartet's voices and the mellow tones generated by five of the finest trombone players available. The ""Five Trumpets"" with the Freshmen is another stellar album. These guys were great, they played their own instuments and worked out the most impressive harmonies ever. This is not barbershop-this is hip and enjoyable musicianship. If you've never heard them before, after you listen to a sample, you may think that you are listening to The Beach Boys in their heyday-Brian Wilson was a huge fan and wanted to emulate the unique sound of The Four Freshman. Do yourself a favor, invite the ""Freshmen"" into your home.",153,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B00000395J,This is one of three FOUR FRESHMEN albums I bought.  They are all wonderful!  I just wish the individual tracks were longer.  Reminds me that for radio play in the fifties and sixties tracks were usually less than three minutes long.,41,9

All the songs, really, are impeccably performed; this group was the finest of its kind for my money. (By the way, the group still exists in the form of a quartet of young replacements  --  it's a kind of Menudoization but the new guys replicate the original group's sound pretty well and are worth a listen.) Anyway, reserve an evening for this classic collection and wallow in the tremendous arrangements and the pure sonic richness.",100,10

That's when I looked on 'Amazon' and there it was . . . Remastered. Great joy!

I didn't really find that the storyline continued in this book. We found out what Ricky did really early in he book and I feel like it kind of went down from there.

Belle and Ricky can't get each other out of there heads. Then Ricky tracks her down and she lets him know she has figured out who he is. Even with both the issues they have, they have a heat and passion, but something more growing between then.
Then the sleepy manager is there again. Ugh.
I love these two together.",66,4
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,This was a really good read book 2 pick up right where book one ended all the answers that I was looking for was finally answered. Belle is still struggling with her insecurities but is  trying to leave the past in the past which is looking pretty slim because her ex decide that he want her back. Ricky secret is finally out it was Belle BFF who was the one to drop the bomb to let her know that he was a rock star. Which had  Belle with her guards up again she doesn't know what Ricky intentions are with her since he didn't tell her who he really was. Both Belle and Ricky have trust issues. So I'm looking forward to seeing what's going to happen in book 3.,130,5
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"OH MY Ricky I couldn't put this book down.  I fell more in love with Ricky and Belle in this book.  They are amazing together.  He is HOT SEXY and OMG.  Amy you out did it on this one,  Thank you again for giving me the ARC copy to review.  I love this series",54,6
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"Belle finally finds out who Ricky is. He is a superstar. He is actively pursuing Belle in the hottest sense. He hints at wanting more,a commitment of some kind. He is inviting Belle more deeply into his life and lifestyle. Of course, all the girls want him but he only had eyes for Belle. Ricky's manager isn't liking the turn of events.
Belle is enjoying Ricky's attentions very much and thinking she could get used to the lifestyle.
Belle is still having to deal with her cheating ex Mike. She is trying to make him understand that she doesn't want him back. Can he take a hint?
In light of her experience with her ex; will Belle be able to handle the the fact that every woman wants a piece of her man? Can she trust him not to cheat? Will Ricky's manager be a problem?",146,7
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"Received as arc for honest opinion
Once again this was a quick read and really it just gave you a little bit of what she does back home. This is where she find out that Ricky is a super international rockstar and it all starts to clip of why he moves so smooth on the dance floor and can sing so good. But this does not change how she feels about him, she doesn't care about his money at all but she is scared about getting serious since she just ended a relationship with her ex mike who all of a sudden shows up trying to get back into the picture.
Book three with take us into his works and let's see how she handles it",126,8
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"The second book of this series is a hot little read - Ricky and Belle can't stay away from each other (and that's ok :-) ) or keep their hands off each other. To me, their love is sweet, but the way the life of a rockstar is presented seems unrealistic. One thing that took me by surprise was Ricky's name - it's virtually identical to the name of an extremely well-known singer/celeb of our day.
If you like to read romance full of hot sex and very little angst, this book is for you.
(I received this book in exchange for an honest review.)",105,9
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"As with part one, I really liked the story and love the characters.  This one seemed to go a lot faster reading wise but maybe that's because the people were already familiar to me.  My favorite part is seeing the shock her ex gets when she comes home from an all night date and he is obviously overcome with jealousy...  Lol...",61,10
Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"Love it, enjoyed and can't wait for the 3rd part.",10,11

Kindle_Store,B00HWZZG5K,"Great Follow-up to book one after returning home from a week long adventure she is unable to keep Ricky off her mind. She receives a gift in the mail and her thought become consumed with him. Her roommate is so excited that she is moving on from her cheating boyfriend of three years, that she encourages her to take a chance. This series so far is a really good sweet read.",71,14
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"Celine Dion's voice is too amazing for words. No matter what albums I receive of hers or what style she is singing, she's amazing. But I'm still extremely partial to this album. This is one of those albums where you can listen to every song and actually like or love every song. The first CD that made me appreciate her talent is still the best to me.",67,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"I bought this CD for a relative and they loved it!!!  I got it for the song ""Fly"" which was the music for the Canadian skater at the Olympics and the rest of the songs were just as lovely.",39,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"Never would have thought that I'd say it.....But this album is nothing short of a gem! An absolute must have.....excellent vocals, beats, and a lot of cool mexican guitar!",29,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"This is one of my all time favorites......there is no one else that can pull this emotion, out of a heart, like Celine can and does!  Her voice is powerful, soothing and makes me want to curl up in my man's arms and forget the world!  Buy this CD....you won't be sorry!",52,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"I bought this CD after hearing""Because you loved me,""by Diane Warren. A wonderfull song from the movie,""Up Close and Personal."" (If you ever look at the Billboard charts,just check out how many songs are  written by Diane,what a talent) When I First played the CD,and ""Its  all coming back to be now,"" came on, I was hooked. What a fantastic  song by Meat Loafs producer Jim Steinman. I just hate to hear this song on  the radio,they cut it terrible.(In my mind,I think this would have been a  great opening number for Barbra Streisand to sing when she made her  concert comeback in the early 90's. About leaving her fans,but returning  where she left off,and its all coming back to her now.) If anyone thinks  Celine can just sing Ballads,wait untill you hear ""River Deep,Mountain  High."" This was Tina Turner's big hit,but Celine brings down the house  with her version,and mentions Tina in the song. When you get to  the last  song, and ""Fly"" comes on,  you will have tears in your eyes. My  Mom died shortly before this record came out,and I think about her  going  to The Light. I have four Celine Dion records,but this one's the best.",200,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"THE FINAL SONG ON CELINE DION'S (FALLING INTO YOU) CD IS ENTITLED, ""FLY"" AND I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS HAS NOT BECOME A HIT SONG OF HERS.  IT IS PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL AND ANYONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED A DEATH IN THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS NEEDS TO HEAR THIS.  IT IS HEART WRENCHING YET VERY CALMING AND SHOULD BE HEARD AT FUNERAL SERVICES ALL THE TIME.  LISTEN TO IT.  IT IS MARVELOUS.",74,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"Man i just luv Celine's CD's aye. This CD is really cool, i really luv River Deep, Mountain High- that is such a cool song! this CD is really good. anyway, i'll just give you the basics of my faves on this CD:

Dreamin' Of You- One of my personal favourites, probably my second, very beautiful song.

Falling into You-  Title Track Song, very cool ballad i guess you would call it..

Call the Man- Another of my faves, very beautiful song, probably my fourth fave song

I Just Don't Know- Probably my third favourite, very good song

River Deep, Mountain High- originally by Tina Turner, my absolute favourite song on this album

and those are just a few of the songs. Mrs Dion has definitely done an excellant job in the making of this CD.",136,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,this is one of the best if not the best that celine has offered......i wouldn't trade it for the world,20,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"Celine shines with her unique set of pipes on this CD. Frankly in pop music, she is a circle of one.
All the songs on this disc are single worthy and not over-produced as would be expected considering Dion's success to date.
She worked hard to get to this point in her career. Her talent and voice prove she deserves it!",61,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,Always love getting Celine's cds just good music and her singing it so good nobody like her I've ever heard before,21,9

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"2 B frank, this is the 1st time 4 me 2 write a review, 'cause in my mind, doing reviews equals wasting time. But I have 2 rate 4 this album. Knowing nothing is perfect, I would give, 2 B exact,a 4.5 to this album(acutally this is the highest rank that I could possibly give).This is, in my opinion,the BEST album of Celine. Trust me, this comment is pretty objective,'cause it comes after my purchasing and listening all of her albums(French&English).

When Celine sings, she pours all of her emotions and sentiments in2 songs, and that's the reason Y her works always possess the power 2 touch our hearts, and this album is a good reflection. Her voice is like an angel's, so pure and so touching, sometimes like whiper of a brook,sometimes like eruption of a volcano. Thanks 2 her passion which controls the change and the transition so wonderfully.

Several No. 1s and some classic songs in this album, which make the album better.

OK,in brief, try this 1!Even if U like other genres of music, this disc is worth a try.",184,12
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"This is one of my favorite collections of songs.  If you like Ceeline, you will love the mix of songs included.  Brilliant.",22,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000002BHE,"This is a awsome cd by celine but why was ""Your Light"" left out of the us version's? I love ""Your Light"" song, it is a great song i just don't understand why she would leave it out...That is why i gave this cd one star! Anyways, my favourite songs are ""Call The Man"" and ""Make You Happy"" and ""I Love You""!!!!=)!!!! Buy this album even though it doesn't have the song ""Your Light"" it is worth it anyway's.",79,14

A great addition to any music collection.
The Avett Brothers are fantastic.",23,0
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"Just drove over 13 hours to see these guys in Mass. and Veromont.  The cds are all great, but you MUST see them live to truly appreciate what they are all about.  Latch onto the purity of this group NOW.",40,1
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,Famous Flower of Manhattan is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. It brings tears to my eyes (especially after a couple of glasses of wine). I just bought this cd the other day just because of that one song...This weekend I'm going to absorb the rest of the cd which I'm sure I'm going to love.,58,2
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"This is a great CD.  It has everything you won't find in the typical music of today.  It's honest, raw, and melodic.  Whether it's the banjo and guitar picking, the duel harmonicas, the wonderful vocal harmonies, or the poignant lyrics, this album has a lot to offer.  I highly recommend their other albums as well.  They have a sound that really speaks to the archetypal memories of my southern roots.

Also, don't miss a chance to see the Avett Brothers live.  They bring an energy to thier shows that's rare to see.",92,3
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"I got this for my friend for her birthday and she couldn't be more pleased with the quality and product :)

It also shipped fast.",25,4
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"Robbinsville is a small town in the mountains of North Carolina, so my wife and I wanted to hear this CD recorded in our hometown.  She's sort of been hogging it because she absolutely loves it.  In the few times I've listened, I've really enjoyed the CD.  If you're into bluegrass, these guys won't dissapoint...they've got an old-time feeling to them that is just great.  I can't wait to see them live.",72,5
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"Worth it for the digital download alone. This album will be known as the mark of their older ""raw"" style in the future (unless Mignonette gets re-released in a similar fashion.",31,6
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"An amazing, amazing album! The first song is infectious and when you think the songs can't get any better, they do. Definitely one of my favorite albums.",27,7
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"This is a key example of how talented these guys are, and a number of the songs are ones I've enjoyed listening to the Avett Brothers play live several times.",30,8
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"this is, imo, the avett's best album.  they have progressed and legitimately ""found their voice,"" but have not crossed the line into overproduction and unnecessary experimentation as they have in their most recent works.",34,9
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"Glad to finally have this on vinyl.
The 6 extra bonus tracks make it worth the price, one of their most iconic albums. A classic to some now, for sure a classic in the future.",35,10
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"I enjoy anything these guys do.  I especially like the older less polished stuff and this goes right along with that trend.  Great music, great energy, great lyrics.  Recommend for any Avett fan.",33,11

CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"I have seen these guys 4 times live and their show just gets better. They sing a lot of songs from this album and I have to say I love every one of them. ""Four Theives Gone"" is my favorite. Enjoy the CD, it is their best and go see them live while you can still afford it.",58,13
CDs_and_Vinyl,B000E0IDJ6,"I discovered the Avett Brothers reading an article on Ramseur Records. In doing further research, I discovered the Avett brothers were former guitar students of a good friend and the Avett family are friends with he and his wife. ""Four Thieves Gone"" was more or less a random pick of their albums. I read the Avett Brothers had a popular stage performance and played a rock'n bluegrass so I was expecting music more akin to something like the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. I have not listened to the band's other albums or a performance. But I didn't hear anything in this albums that would fit the stage performance image in the article. ""Four Thieves Gone"" may have been an studio experiment for the Avett Brothers....something like the Beattles' White Album was for the Beattles. I enjoy the album quite a bit but I am not sure fans of modern day bluegrass or even rock will agree.",156,14
