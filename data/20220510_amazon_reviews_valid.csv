Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"i have not used, but it have all the things for airbrush and i thing it going to work prety well, it's finish details are pretty well",27,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Great value for the price. This brush works very well and it did not cost an arm and a leg. I would definitely recommend this product to other looking for an inexpensive but well built air brush.,37,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Excellent product.  The paint is delivered smoothly with excellent coverage.  Cleanup and maintenance is easy.  I highly recommend the S62 Master Airbrush.,22,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I was thinking about purchasing this item when I noticed that there are two different images showing different parts. One case shows a quick disconnect and the other does not. Which is correct? Giving two stars until I now exactly what comes with this product before I purchase.,48,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Im not to airbrushing and got this as an efficient and controllable way to paint small hobby parts - I have no idea how it works for tshirts or other airbrush uses. It fits my needs perfectly and I would definitely buy this again.,44,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,This is a really nice airbrush. Took me a little bit to get used to but works great. Thanks for saving my day!,23,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Bday gift for my son..he said it is smaller that what he'd thought but nice products. He is using it to airbrush some doors on cars and motorcycles,28,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"I bought this for body painting. My other siphon feeds did not spray fast enough for body painting and the gravity feeds take too long to change colors. With this one I can spray a small or large pattern without having streaks and color changes only takes seconds. Just buy extra bottles for multiple colors.

The only thing I don't like is the trigger shape. It is flat and round. I like the one on my other master airbrushes better. It has a slope to it.",86,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"I just received this AB in the mail...  very quick shipping!
Fit and finish is excellent!  I'm very impressed with the heft and overall quality.
Definitely recommended!!!",27,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Been wanting an airbrush for years and finally ordered this one (my first) last week. Was looking forward to it and it arrived today. I was excited. The airbrush is in perfect condition, all parts listed included.

Then I went to connect it to the air compressor. That's where things fell flat. Seems the hose and connections do not fit a standard air compressor without an adapter. That adapter is not included in the set.

So, I have now ordered the adapter and must wait for it to arrive before I can use the airbrush.

This company has been around for a while and I know I am not the first person to experience this. It would seem an intelligent decision to include the appropriate adapter in this set. At the very least, it should be advised in the description that this adapter is necessary for standard air compressor use.

My hope was to post a picture tonight of my first airbrush artwork. Unfortunately, that's not possible at this time.",170,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Used it twice shortly after receiving it and it worked fine. Cleaned it according to the instructions and put it away. Month or two later got it out and the only thing it does is bubble up in the paint bottle. Contacted customer support and was told it is probably a dirty or defective nozzle. Tried three different nozzle sets, one of which had never been used, and all acted the same way, bubbles in the paint bottle. Contacted customer support again and was asked if I would like a return authorization and they would look at it. Replied three times and never got a response. Right now it is totally useless and there is no response from customer service.",120,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Airbrush came w/o hose. Hose was replaced promptly. Hooked it up and found bottle will not stay in body. Just falls out.
Purchased new bottles and they just fall out as well. Holding bottle in found airbrush would not draw material. Air comes through but no material sprayed. Had to disassemble to find needle jammed in so hard it could not move. Should not have to fix something before you even use it!
Sent e-mail to seller and received no answer at all.
A waste of time and money. I will stay with my usual brand from now on.(Pa)",99,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,There wasn't any instructions with it and it seems like a piece was missing from the foam insert.,18,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,had problems upon first use . buy better this one is cheap .,13,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"works as described but it never came with air hose, the one thet sent me had 1/4 & 1/8 ends where as I need both ends to be 1/8""",29,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Hello i have ordered this product in the past I've contactexTCP global couple times. Never had a problem any other Master Series brushes love them until this one I just received 622 set. But all three needles and tips are spraying off center emailed couple times gave me a link to do cleanings did them still have problems don't know what to do I want to keep this product I like it need help,74,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Hose is NOT included with this even though it is prominently displayed on the web page.  There is no 'whats included' (or in this case 'excluded') anywhere in the description.  I call this manufacturer's fraud.  Amazon, to their credit, did partially reimburse the extra cost of a hose, but that doesn't make up for the time wasted on this (and that the item is now overpriced since it doesn't include the hose).

UPDATE: I ordered a hose only to find out that it would not fit on to the airbrush because the airbrush's threaded bushing was defective.  The body of the bushing flared out at the bottom and was a larger diameter than the remainder of the body.  As a result of this, the bottom most threads were squashed into the adjacent threads.",133,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"cheap the hose wouldnt even screw on gun , it looks as if gun was plated to heavy threads to thick",21,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I bought two of these sets and neither one came with a hose. The picture and description included a hose.,20,18
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,It's ok for the money! I had to get a new .8 needle and tip because it wold not work. But even with the new one it still gives me a hard time.  I am just going to save up for a good one,44,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"This is a nice tool.  Produces a nice clean spray.  For the money, you cant ask for more.",18,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Very please with this airbrush for the money! I'll be purchasing more in the future,15,21
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"This airbrush more than exceeded my expectations. It has a nice weight to it, sprays very well and comes with three different needle sizes. It has actually outperformed some of the more expensive airbrushed I've had in the past. I will be purchasing at least one more in the future.",50,22
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"airbrush is the best one i have of all seven i own , i would buy again.
it comes with extras i like it a lot .i give it 5 stares",31,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Nice little gun.  I am just beginning so this was a good quality item for the money spent.  Great for the beginner or student.,24,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I was more than pleased with this airbrush system. It was a gift to my grandson and he has used the heck outta this thing. Very happy with it.,29,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,If you are buying this as a complete set (as pictured) don't.  It does not come with the air hose,20,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Product is not compatible with anything that is not master brand. All connections and fittings will not work with any other brand of compressor or fixture. Such as paint cups paint jars exc. If you're not planing to use exclusively master products, and I wouldn't it's an inferior brand, than don't buy this.",53,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Paint doesn't want to spray for some reason, it will blow air but not paint doesn't.",16,28
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Works well with DuraCoat one time!!! After that it stopped.,10,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I bought this kit but the paint jar was a really sloppy fit and would not hold in place. I tried some other paint jars but same story so the mount on the actual airbrush is slightly to big. So unfortunately I could not test the brush as the jar kept falling off. I have to send it back so its a real time waster for me . Very disappointed.,70,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"I am a Pro T-Shirt artist and purchased a set of these airbrushes...for the price of these airbrushes , you get a good valued airbrush.... they are engineered copies of a ""top brand"" Japanese made for less than 1/2 the price (these are made in Taiwan or China)...yes this means that sometimes a nozzle cap may be not be machined perfectly but TCP Global has excellent customer service and will replace anything that is not correct. These airbrushes will work for a beginner or a pro. If you want a better airbrush , then be prepared to spend more....these are not bad for the price. I can still make $ using these, so in my opinion, cant go wrong.",119,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Wasn't real impressed with this unit. I purchased this to do some detail work and the tip would clog constantly. The paint bottle would also never seat tight and fall out and make a huge mess. My Harbor freight brush is a much better gun and at $14 delivered a much better value.,53,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Haven't used it yet but it looks like it can do the job.,13,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Right out of the box the airbrush spit paint and had uneven, sporadic flow.  Took it apart, cleaned thoroughly and attempted to spray straight brush cleaner through it with the same results.  Tried another tip and the larger needle set.  Less air and less cleaner came out of the airbrush.  Put it back in the box and sent it back.

My brother has the same airbrush and it works great for him.  Poor quality and loose manufacturing tolerances.",78,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Gave this as a Christmas gift, just found out the air brush itself never worked,doesn't spray just bubbles in jar. An expert looked at it and said the head cap was drilled incorrectly!! This is a piece of junk, apparently they aren't tested at the factory.",46,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I bought this gun to use in my Gunsmithing business. I have sprayed two different guns with Duracoat and has worked flawlessly. It needs to be cleaned like any other gun which is to be expected if you want to continue using it. I would recommend this airbrush for anyone getting started.,52,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Not happy with this airbrush. Update Just called TCP Global they are sending a new needle. Will revise if all works out.
I bought this on Feb 5 and the first time I used it is today March 24. I put the .8 needle in and the airbrush blows air into the bottle. I tried spraying water thinking maybe my paint was too thick but it will not even spray water. I put the .5 needle in and it sprays. The reason I bought this is because of the flexibility of 3 needles. Sometimes I need to get a bigger spray pattern or need to flow more paint. Hopefully I can still return this one. At the same time I bought the G223 set and that works perfectly.",128,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,You get what you pay for. Simple as that.,9,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Love it so far. Now if my skill can get better.,11,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Works As Good As My Pashaee At 1/3 The Price.,10,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Airbrush is above average and the price is really good but it would be five stars if all the nozzles worked. Only one nozzle and needle combo worked .5  the company sent me replacements but only one of the two replacements worked. There is no QC for the nozzles they are way out of spec. Very disappointed because the airbrush is actually very good,64,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"The kit was so tempting because of the extra needles and tips.  However, I had an issue I've not seen before where on my first use, the gun would blow bubbles back into the jar forcing the paint out the breather hole.  It made a mess and the brush became unusable.
I returned it (thank you amazon) and got the Paache TS series and the extra fan tip wich has worked fabulously for applying cerakote and other thin finishes to metal parts.  The action on the Paache is much smoother also.  I had them both side by side and the build quality seems pretty similar with a slight edge to the Paache.
I have other products from Mater Airbursh like there mini gravity feed spray gun that work awesome so I was disappointed.  I'm sure I probably just got a defective one.",142,42
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,This airbrush is a good quality item.  I have only used it a little and am still learning about it but it appears that it will do a good job in the hands of a knowledgeable person.,37,43
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Great air brush, easy to use, works well.",8,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"This airbrush was purchased on speculation. I wanted a replacement for my old Badger. I was suspect of the price. It is really a good bargan for the price. It works more than adequately for my needs, in particular armored vehicles. I am pleased with the performance to date.",49,45
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Very upset want a refund came used scratches and dirt on it it's a shame,15,46
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"This is my first experience with airbrushing. Quality seems very good for the money. My only complaint is that the supplied hose did not come with an adapter to connect to some sort of standard pipe thread so I could connect it to an air compressor. I cut one end of hose off and used a ""barb"" type connector, everything has worked just as it should since.",67,47
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I just got into body airbrushing and this has been a great starter airbrush. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I would recommend this for anyone starting out.,31,48
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Haven't tried to actually use it yet, but mine did not, I repeat did not, include the quick disconnect. This is in spite of the fact that both the picture and the description say that a quick disconnect is included. Very disappointed. There is not even a place in the foam insert for one. It's as if the manufacturer has dropped that piece without telling anyone. Again, very disappointed. This feature is very very important to me. My one star rating will remain unless the manufacturer makes good on it.",90,49
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Ben nye nor wicked airbrush paints didn't run smoothly through it at all. This brush requires extremely liquidated paint to spray without spattering. I know you can't just spray any paint through these, but I'd expect a good quality airbrush to spray various airbrush paints. Other than that, works great! Easy to clean, easy to use, wide/narrow spray range, great starter/low priced airbrush!",63,50
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"This air brush lasted all of 1 minute before it clogged up, I took it apart and cleaned it all and reassembled it and it clogged up in thirty seconds or less. so far I have taken it apart three times and cleaned it and it still clogs. Don't waste you money on this!",54,51
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"For an inexpensive airbrush, this is great.  I am new to airbrushing and have found it to be very easy to use.  With the 3 tips I can spray from a pencil line to a 2"" stroke.  I was using my friends more expensive airbrush while he was giving me some tips and the Master Airbrush works just as well.",60,52
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I bought this to paint/touch up small components in an industrial setting.  So far it has worked very well.  Having the three different sized tips is very nice.  I'm not an artist and do not use this to do design work.  Overall I am impressed with the quality for the price.,51,53
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"DOA on Arival, no help from seller package missing parts, and looked used. Never could use, and seller has nothing but excuses.
AVOID THIS PRODUCT AND TCP GLOBAL AT ALL COST....",31,54
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Abysmal. I tried every possible option on this planet to make this darned thing work, all to no avail. First, the darned hose does not fit any kind of compressed air can available. So, I had to buy a hose adapter for the can. Turns out, that hose adapter does not fit the hose included with this kit. So I bought a different hose. Still no luck. So I bought a set of universal adapters. Guess what? They leak. Finally used plumbers tape to staunch the leak, only to find that the airbrush itself does not work. It will not feed paint at all. I tried disassembling and cleaning. No luck. I even tried using water to get something -- anything -- to feed. I tired every setting. No luck.  So now this entire kit from hell is sitting at the bottom of my garbage can.  I am pissed.",149,55
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,This is the 3rd Master s62 I got. really good airbrush for the price,14,56
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Love it.  Runs great.  Easy to use.  Well be buying another for myself so my husband can have his back.,20,57
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"I bought this for hobby use, spraying epoxy coatings and it works well for the price.  Had to make a trip to the hardware store to connect to my shop compressor.  Will not attach to a std quick connect fitting.  Glass jar cleans up great for repeated use.",48,58
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"Works marginally. I use this to apply bake on finishes for firearms. The rear portion of the airbrush housing is threaded on. This portion of my airbrush can literally be pulled off with little force. It's as if the threads are several thou smaller. It will fall off in your hand with little movement. I just remove it when using the gun. I doesn't appear to affect the gun while painting without it but the fact that it falls off gives this thing a 3 star quality. The bottles are easy to clean and so is the gun.

UPDATE: December 19, 2015; so after a year the gun has quit working. I will say it has been a pretty good gun to use other than the above issues. I dropped it onece on the concrete floor, rather it fell from my work bench and received a small dent in the nose cap that didn't affect function however after that use the gun quit working completely. I suspect that the type of paint (Cerakote) I was using was to blame as it clogged the gun up pretty bad. I cleaned the dickens out of it but can't get it to spray paint at all.",203,59
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,Very fast shipping and just what it was supposed to be!!!,11,60
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,i like this product its very easy to use,9,61
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,This airbrush works great.  I had the C16 and I didn't like it as much.  I am a beginner at this but the S62 is a lot less messy and easier for me to operate.,35,62
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,I originally ordered a gravity fed airbrush and although I'm sure it would have been nice for smaller task this siphon fed one has a much nicer output of air and paint and I am pleased with its performance. Thanks.,40,63
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00BGL5SQ8,"This airbrush is well balanced and has a solid feel. However, once in use it never worked properly... Wanting to understand why it wasn't working properly, I dismantled the airbrush and lost the air valve casing NUT. So, I oredered their repair kit (major) but the NUT did not fit. After a couple of times trying to get the right part I gave up dealing with the seller...and so the airbrush is now a paper weight",76,64
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,Not bad. You can probably find a cheaper version at the art store if you're not looking for anything super fancy. These ones have a very thin border.,28,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,I am very happy with the speedy delivery and the quality of the canvas is really good. The paints adhere more evenly than on other canvases.,26,1

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,Appeared to be a quality canvas for a beginner. Absolutely no complaints,12,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"I never used them for the project I got them for, but the quality seems mediocre.  I'm not an expert in canvas frames by any means, and surely anyone buying frames for professional-quality art would not be using a frame like this, but for a home art project or student/novice level work, these would probably be adequate.",57,5

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"These worked great for my extremely amateur needs! Best price, they are a great size, and they were easy to use.  We used oil paints to make a christmas present, and it worked fine.  Highly recommend it if you need a nice, inexpensive set of canvasses.",46,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004558FMG,"Better than the 11"" x 14"" canvas, but still have some pilling.  I was of the impression they were primed and ready for painting.  I am a novice, so don't know exactly what to expect on some of the products.",40,10

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"What can I say? It's a patch. I bought it to attach to my Massif Combat Shirt. It's definitely the best fabric patch I've ever seen. No fraying whatsoever, authetic MC, and just plain good quality. Definitely recommend it.",39,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"I will make this short, as it is only a patch. Price was fair. Shipping was fast. Patch was perfect regarding detail and stitching. The ONLY issue is that a portion of the velcro was melted (not sure why). So the upper right portion doesn't attach so well. Other than that, it's very nice.",54,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,Hard to screw up this type of product. Well made and stays on my jacket.,15,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"Not too thick or evey, I actually stripped the velcro off the backing and sewed it onto my hat (that I stripped the velcro off of) so I could see it on for a more natural look. And the pacth, and others I've got have all worked out remarkably well.",50,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,Looks exactly as pictured.  Quality stitching.  Velcro sticks very well.,10,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"Would have gotten all 5, I honestly love all the patches in Multicam from Gadsden and Culpeper.. But the one in particular I received wasn't as detailed stitching wise, but still a good patch. I may have gotten just a less quality one! Doesn't scare me away from buying more from these guys in the future though! =)",58,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"Good quality patch except for one thing.  The particular section of Multicam in my patch had a large section of dark brown right behind the stitching, making it hard to see or read.",33,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,Quality stitching and designed to last. Colors match multicam perfectly. Was exactly what I expected to come from a morale patch in regards to quality.,25,13

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,This is a high-quality patches good Velcro. The embroidery is very well-done with no frays. I bought several patches and enjoy them,22,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"Patch was okay, but a bit smaller than I anticipated, so text was pretty small and hard to read unless up close.  Was nice that it had Velcro already sewn on.",31,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B007287S08,"I don't know if I just got a lemon or what. Seems like a good patch, well stitched as far as I know. Received it promptly.

Multicam? Maybe. Maybe the worst selection of multicam fabric available to the maker. Mine has three colors and seems like it would fit with my old bdu's better than my multicam uni. The embroidery on the snake and quote seem a little lacking too.

I wouldn't buy another one or wear it on my uni but I will slap it on a range bag or something.

I noticed one person said it will go great with their condor hat. If you are the type of person who has no problem with the quality condor offers then this patch will suit your needs.

Overall not upset because the price wasn't a gouge to my pocketbook. Hopefully Gadsden and culpepper have some other products that will suit my needs. I usually give a company two or three tries. This was their first strike.",167,17

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,These die cuts are beautiful.  A great investment to my die cut collection.,13,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,Great little dies. They cut beautifuly. Very pleased. Sizzix always seems to deliver.,13,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,These dies cut beautifully! I love them use them all the time!,12,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"I love these dies. Exceed my expectation.
Small but worth every penny.",12,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"I already had the leaf die pictured in brown from Stampin Up, so waffled on getting this set. Im so glad I went ahead and ordered it!  I love it - lots of variety! Great price, too.",37,4

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,Lovely selection of greenery to cut ahead in variety of shades so I'm ready to create.,16,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,Pretty dies but extremely small. I liked that this included smaller versions of several of the Sizzix steel dies. But I was hoping to use a few of them for felt and they are just so small they pull apart immediately. The stems are so thin I'm not even sure they'd work well with cardstock. But I'm sure they'd be pretty on very sturdy cardstock for a card. I would skip them if you're thinking of felt. Even doubled up/stiffened felt they won't work.,84,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"The dies cut well, but the leaves are way to small for my purposes.  I really don't know what I can use them for.  They could be a nice addition to small flowers only.

I WOULD HAVE MUCH PREFERRED FEWER DIES IN A LARGER, MORE USABLE SIZE.  AS IS, THEY ARE A WASTE OF MONEY!",55,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,For felt crafting I thought that I would like these but they are much smaller than I expected. FOr paper they would probably work really well.,26,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,Images I needed and some new ones to try. Nice set.,11,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,Beware! These dies are actually very tiny.  Not what I was expecting.,12,11

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,glad I I purchased these dies.  I'm always in need of different ferns for my crafts.,16,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,Add great accent to cards and other paper crafts,9,14

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,Perfect for collage card-making! Shipped quickly; all pieces in excellent condition. Will return to shop again!,16,16
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"I love this versatile set!  I've recently started making paper flowers, and this set has the foliage I need for my cards.  Some cuts have to be gently removed from the die, but it's not too difficult.",37,17
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"cuts well, perfect for cars and scrapbook pages. wide variety wish it had matching stamps",15,18

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"These metal dies worked great with my cuddle bug. I used the. All at once using the a, c and b plates and only one stem did not cut through.

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"As usual, a wonderful product from Tim Holtz.
I like using leaves and vines in my art journal and these give great results when I cut up my gelli prints etc.
A versatile mix.",34,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,I am very impressed on the leaves it creates and how easy it was to do.  I cut our about 50 leaves in less than an hour.,27,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"Love them.
Not exact measurements but close enough.",8,26
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B01GUFFQDE,"These are pretty foliage dies and I am glad that I purchased them. I use a Big Shot with the Precision plate and they cut well. I expected the leaves to have veins or some detail to emboss but they don't so I am a bit surprised by that because Tim Holtz's products usually include small details such as this. Overall, I really like them and drew in some veins and embossed some with a pointy tool.",77,27
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"My fault for not reading the ""mini"" part. But I got this tape for indicating injury on my gi at martial arts and it does the job perfectly. Even stays on after a few washes so I don't have to re-tape every class.",43,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"Ok. Sleep deprived mom here. READ THE MEASUREMENTS. IT IS 3/4THS OF AN INCH THICK. It looks like a regular size role in photo, but isn't.  Don't be like me. Sooooo..... small..... still good tape.... but can't do what I need. I'll go get more sleep now...

Joanns has it full price for $2.99.... you can use a coupon to make it half off....",64,1

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,Tiniest roll of duct tape! Didn't realize I wasn't getting a tankard size roll of tape.,16,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"Beware!!! Read the reviews and the description before you buy this product. Everything this seller does from the photo to the price leads you into believing the product is legitimate; however, it is smaller than a roll of scotch tape.",40,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,exactly as ordered - take note it is 0.75 inches wide so its not as wide as standard duct tape. that is what i was looking for though.,28,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,"Those buyers who left poor feedback are idiots.  They clearly cannot read.  The product clearly describes the 0.75 inch size of the width of this tape.  Why give the seller less than 5 stars if YOU (the buyer) are the ones that cannot read.

The product is exactly has described and is exactly what I was looking for and needed.  Thank you ShurTech for the tape.  It is perfect!  I will buy more as needed.",75,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B00MX5UEYC,It's TINY. My fault for not reading the description but shame on this company for charging so much for this product. Bought a normal sized roll of duck tape for the same price.,33,14

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"These crystals were beautiful on my Christ Tree Wall Hanging.
Just the added sparkle really made a difference.
The Swarovski items are certainly a cut above the others.",28,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,These were poor quality and wouldn't work with my hot fix gun. They would fall out. Wasted a. Few and gave up using some nice ones I had bought at a bead store in town. They weren't very sparkly. Can't believe they are Swarovski.  I returned them no problem for a refund.,52,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"Shiny and stay on well, no problem washing",8,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,The jewels tend to fall off after a few washing (even on the delicate cycle) and hanging to dry.  but they work great when used on the invitations we make.,30,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,Do not look like Swarovski crystals....they are very very clouded compared to the real sparkly clear Swarovski crystals. Definitely NOT crystal clear.  These were actually the replacement shipment for my first order....my first order I received flatbacks and they actually were crystal clear but not the hotfix that I wanted.,50,11

I highly recommend these for the dance costumes!",24,19
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,I am still in the process of blinging up a bandana that I folded to wear as a headband.  It is turning out just as I had imagined.  These are very clear and give me all the bling I hoped for.,41,20
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,these look good I have not yet used any of these. I am looking forward to that.. cant wait to shine,21,21

The hot fix tool works really well and the stones look great on stage!",25,23
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,Beautiful stones with great clarity.  I would buy these again. They were reasonably priced also.  They look great on my project.,21,24
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"I make lots of costumes, and these rhinestones are a must.
Be sure to hold the hot tip ~20 seconds at least.",22,25
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"I bought these a year ago & finally used them, wow they shine so bright! I ran out and bought a cheaper kind that came like in bulk, BIG mistake. Next to these the other crystals looked very cloudy & opaque, these may cost a bit more, but u get what you pay for. They dried perfectly on the satin shoes I placed them on.",65,26

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,This was my first purchase of hot fix stones and what a great product and had fun bedazzling items for new grand daughter,23,29
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,Beautiful stones but aa little more expensive than I like. my mother makes flower brooches and would have to charge a lot more for them if she used these stones.,30,30
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"They sparkle better, have more lead content in the glass, and they adhere well to fabrics.  What's not to like?",20,31
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,I love these! They add the perfect sparkle to just about anything. I have transformed inexpensive tank tops into something special for vacations or anytime!,25,32
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"I haven't counted or tried them yet and I will keep them, but I have Swarovski crystals I bought at a store and these lack brilliance and sparkle. If these are Swarovski crystals, I'm Angelina Jolie (NOT!)",37,33
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,I am a first time buyer and user to this product. I like the quality and the price. I would order them again.,23,34
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"I love these crystals!!!!!!! They have a lot of fire!!!!! I would definitely buy a lot more, and recommend anyone who crafts to get them too!!!!!!! Great company to deal with!!!!!!",31,35
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,The crystals were easy to apply and look professionally applied.  No extra glue showing around the edges.  The crystals sparkle and bring your eye to the design I made.  I'm very happy with this purchase.,35,36
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,I purchased these along with a hot fix heat tool and they worked amazing. We were making shirts for work and we used the crystals on cotton tees...they couldn't have turned out better if we would have bought them at the store! They have stayed put after several washes too! Love them!,52,37
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,The rhinestones are very nice and the right size for my floral project! I was very impressed! Will be ordering more!!!,21,38
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"i wanted to use this on my phone, and they are beautiful. there are enough rhinestones to cover it and my ipod too.",23,39
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,Rhinestones were good quality.  I was surprised at the small amount of rhinestones I received for the price.  Apparently you get a little for a lot of money.,28,40
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,Junk- will not affix- went back to the same ones I bought from Hobby Lobby no issues,17,41
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,"I love the effect of these hotfix crystals in my fiber work. In the past, I've used them sparingly, but my latest project requires a lot of bling so I purchased this package of 144.

Thank you,

Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B0028N8M2K,Love these! I ordered them for my wedding to bling my converse out and they truly do sparkle and shine! I get compliments on how sparkly they are and ask where I got the rhinestones from and they are shocked when I tell them I ordered from Amazon and give them the link to this seller! Not only was the seller fast with shipping but the rhinestones were exactly as stated and loved them!!,74,44
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,These are the neatest little things. I use them to put on top of special gifts...can put a beautiful little flower arrangement on top....and it looks spectacular!,27,0
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,10 out of 12 of these mini's were no longer glued to their base upon arrival of the package - not sure what the problem here but I now have to glue each piece of foam back to the base if Id like to use them.,46,1
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,"We received the order quickly.  It was just as promised online.  We may not use it for making the pew bows that we intended  - because making the bows is a lot more time consuming than I realized.  However, the product can be used for other things.",47,2
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,Arrived crushed were not in box as displayed.  Over half of them unsuable. Do Not Purchase! Waste if money!,19,3
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,To small for my need couldn't do anything with it - also crushed,13,4
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,These were adorable! I added the little battery rice lights and we tied back curtains.,15,5
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,"Many of these arrived broken and were a crushed crumbly mess.  I had enough undamaged ones to use for my project so I did not send them back but beware if you need all of them, that you may encounter some broken ones.  They undamaged ones worked great for mini flower arrangements.",52,6
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,These were PERFECT for embellishing an evergreen table garland for 40 foot long wedding reception tables !,17,7
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,They are smaller than I expected but will work perfectly on wine bottles!,13,8
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,"These are fantastic for arranging fresh flowers in small containers. They stick to the bottom of the container and hold in place very well, even when wet. Wish I had found them years ago.",34,9
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,These can work really well for small projects but to echo other reviewers you should order more than you  need. In my last pack of 12 one the foam came completely detached while soaking and a couple others crumbled. You shouldn't submerge them in water because that will ruin the adhesive. They're really expensive for how small and unreliable they are.,61,10
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,I bought these to decorate some lanterns for window decorations for my daughters wedding where just a few flowers were needed to accent the foliage and ribbons.  Awesome product!,29,11
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,the balls came unglued from the plastic. it needs to have a cage over it.,15,12
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,Most of these worked really well for making floral decorations on wine bottles.  I had problems with the adhesive and the foam breaking away from the plastic on quite a few.,31,13
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,These make decorating with fresh flowers a breeze!,8,14
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,I put these in a basket of gardening tools that I gave to my sister who loves to garden.  It was the perfect little something that you would never think to buy for yourself.  She loved them and her arrangements from her garden look great.,45,15
Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing,B004AM4B4K,Love the Mini Decos. I was sticking it from cake box to picture frame,14,16

Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"First time I used it the handle broke right off, I hadn't used it more then a few hours.  Very disappointed, returned for a refund.",25,1
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,this is a well crafted car wash brush. the brush head is nice and wide which makes washing your car/truck easy and quick. the handle is well fabricated and comfortable to utilize. great product and great shipping!,37,2

Automotive,B000ZLSF74,easy to use on my toyota highlander since I can't reach over the top.  would be perfect for min ivan,20,4
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Initial use was washing camper's awning and was super both in handling suds and scrubbing as well as rinsing! AND flexible length was just perfect - able to reach clear to back, wind-up, portion of awning! Strength enough to scrub even when fully extended! And head able to carry the soap up to awning while scrubbing! Best one I've used! d.",61,5
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Foam handle do not stay in place after getting wet. They slide up and down the pole.,17,6
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,I have boats and cars.  Saw this in the store for twice as much - used my phone price checker and Amazon had it.  Ordered it for 1/2 standing right there.  This is a really nice brush.  Just a note:  Came in a box the size of a car hood.,50,7
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Very well built. Worth every penny. I have 2 for washing the boat and car.,15,8
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"About the right size, soft bristles, removes dirt well where scrubbed.  You can really tell where this brushed was used; It is a lot cleaner then any spot you miss.  It is a bit heavy, due to the hefty and sturdy extension pole, which makes horizontal surfaces easier  to scrub but vertical ones harder to scrub since the brush is always want to drop downwards.  However, the sturdy extension pole will hold up to lots of use as a results.  Personally, 4 feet alone is plenty long enough to clean my car so I will not be using that feature.  The flow through feature is pretty useless and I will not be using it.  I just sort of dumps water out the very center.  It has zero spread throughout the brush.  Just use the hose alone for MUCH better and faster control of any water.  I use a foaming ""cannon"" to soap down the car which only takes seconds and does hosing off afterwards.  Brush is about the right size (10"") for a relatively quick scrubbing while getting a majority of the curved surfaces but also get a smaller brush as well.  Nice grips make rotation of brush easier.",199,9
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Doesn't scratch my paint! haven't hooked it up to my hose or anything but as a stand alone brush for a short girl with a SUV it does the job! :),31,10
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Works great for washing my suv. The handle extension is perfect for reaching the roof.  Love having the water attached for rinsing.,22,11
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Plastic hose fittings are not sturdy enough.  Broke after 1st use, now it's a brush on a long stick!",19,12
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"purchased it for my honda pilot and it really helps me alot to clean my SUV quick and throughly.
it makes huge differences when you need to clean top of your SUV or any other tall vehicles.
only downside is that, with arm fully extended, you may find it slightly heavy.
However, I'd strongly recommend it if you do clean your vehicles at home often.",65,13
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"I bought this item because I saw a neighbor using something similar and thought ""wow, what a great way to clean a car - that looks so easy!"".  In the end, I suppose I was wrong. I find it easier to wash the car using mitts and a bucket.

The product itself is built reasonably well, though some of the adjustments don't stay put as well as I'd like. It is solid, easy to connect to a hose and the flow-thru is adjustable and works well. The brush won't scratch the car, but it also doesn't do very well in getting anything like bugs off of the car. I see this is most useful for an initial rinse off or scrubbing. But again, I think mitts are more useful if you have enough of them.",135,14
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Works great! I use it on the windows and siding on my house and highly recommend it!,17,15
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,works fine; but I should have read the description more closely; I thought it also had a built-in soap dispenser which is what I was really looking for...,28,16
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,the water pressure drops considerably when using the hose attachment.,10,17
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"I had another brand which was getting worn out.  The other one had basically one stream of water squirting out the middle which was useful when you wanted to just rinse what you had just washed.  This one the water doesn't squirt out, it just gushes out.  It's better for spreading more water into the brush but useless for rinsing.  I guess you can't have it both ways.  Also, the various joints need to be tightened often or they begin to leak but not a huge deal, just twist them tight again.",92,18
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Best car wash brush ever. It is soft, water runs through it like a band of sailors on leave and grime leaves my car as if one dedicated devil dog was scrubbing it with a toothbrush.",36,19
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,This is a Rugged one with the strong brace at the brush where they always break!,16,20
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Nice soft brush . I'm using it to wash my solar panels . The extension pool is not. That long.,20,21
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Very easy solution for a quick touch up without the expense of a car wash.,15,22
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Bristles are coming out after one use and leaks terribly at handle even after adding new hose washers. Handle was also much shorter than I thought it would be. Probably be in our next garage sale.,36,23

Automotive,B000ZLSF74,my husband had me buy this for him to use to wash the vehicles and our 30 ft camper............works great.,20,28
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,nice brush and telescopic handle. price is even better,9,29
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Works great and used it a lot on the RV already,11,30
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Got this for my boyfriend who loves to wash his cars. Great for getting the hard to reach spots and the top of the truck.,25,31
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,My husband got this for washing his car and he loves it. He loves it!,15,32
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"This thing is great. Every neighbor that has seen it has asked about it.
Makes washing a big truck a good bit more manageable than it would be with a sponge.
Not quite sure what parts ""are known to cause cancer"", so that was slightly disconcerting, but I guess everything causes cancer these days.
The connections don't leak, but it's sometimes a pain to get them screwed together and you have to use focused force to make sure everything is going to stay in place once you get it adjusted to your desired length.
The ""head"" fits into a standard 5 gallon bucket OK, so dipping into soap solution isn't a big deal (I was worried it wouldn't fit).
I find that 6 ""soap stops"" and subsequent rinses are enough to complete a 4 door Ram 1500.",137,33
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"The handle has a constant tendency to slide off and give you a bath.
Drilled a hole and put a nut and bolt to secure and stopped the sliding off.
It's great for washing windows, which is why I purchased it.
Would have got 5 stars if they built in a stop / lock for the handle.",57,34
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,AMAZING!! I will be purchasing another one! Easy to wash my car and suv. Soft and easy to handle. Perfect!,20,35
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,It is very well made. definitely helps with washing the hard to reach spots on my car.,17,36
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Very good and well made, it can withstand any type of scrubbing and washing . ",15,37
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"I try to keep my truck clean.  I do a lot of work with the local Fire Department and I get real grief when I show up to a fire with a dirty red truck.

A brush with flow-through water makes it easy to keep the truck washed of in any weather and this brush is soft enough to be safe for any finish. The head is a little larger than some and won't get into some tight spaces but that would be true for almost any brush of this type. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the plastic hardware where the hose connects. It doesn't seem sturdy and I feel it would break easily if dropped on the ground.  For this reason, I keep an expandable hose attached to it all of the time so I won't have to constantly connect and disconnect - hopefully safer for the fittings. If this is the kind of brush you need, I'd recommend it.  It's the best of this type I've ever used.",175,38
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Never got to use it due to handle being bent and the handle would not slide to extend. It did not appear bent as much as it seems oval or swelled in the handle. I also have a 93977 and it is great but the 93097 is the on I really wanted.,52,39
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Nice soft bristle brush. Good handle. ''Works like it is supposed  to. Highly recommend!,14,40
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Great quality. Soft bristles.  Love that you can control the amount of water going through the wand.,17,41
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Works okay.  The one I received from Amazon was damaged (bristles were flattened on half the brush).  After returning the brush, I found the it (same brand  and model brush) for a much lower price at Walmart.  I gave it another try.,",42,42
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Water leaks at the seams. Cleans the vehicle well though.,10,43
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"This is a really great carwash brush, with lots of length, great durability, and nice bristles on the head.  The foam handles keep my hands from blistering, and the brush speeds up my carwash time significantly.",36,44
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Works great perfect for my truck, brush could be a little bigger but no complaints.",15,45
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Much better than a similar brush that I got at the hardware store.  The extendible wand is a great help.,20,46
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"This brush remains rigid even under pressure applied. I have used it on my truck and my wife's SUV for the top surfaces. For the sides I prefer a hand mitt. It will hold soap well,and have not seen any webbing caused by it. Very happy with it !",49,47
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"This product is ok.  Brush did clean well and water flow worked well.  However, the water control valve moves too easily while cleaning (probably just my hand position) and cannot always keep it set on the low or high setting.  I did like that although it has two setting for high and low, you can control the flow to almost any water pressure.  But it moves too easily, even when you don't want to move it.  I did not like that the head is flat and not angled, which makes it hard to angle brush for higher and farther to reach places.  The head will also need regular tightening as fitting easily comes loose.  It would be ideal if the brush head could be adjustable.  I ended up cleaning our vehicle without the water hose attached, which I found to be faster, lighter, and easier to control.",147,48
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,Brush does a great job of cleaning my cars without scratching them. The extension is the right size to get across my SUV end to end and allows me to clean it in record time with little effort. Good price too!,41,49
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Works as advertised, water flows through while scrubbing. Not much else to report, if you're looking for a simple brush to help build a good lather, this one works fine. No issues encountered so far.",35,50
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"The attachment for the hose popped off the very first time I used it Tried to attach it several ways, but it didn't work. Very disappointed in that feature. However, even without the hose, just using it with a soapy bucket of water it was still very easy to use and all of the extensions were fine.",57,51
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"I bought this for my husband, who had trouble washing the top of his pickup.  He says it works really well.",21,52
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Easy to use.  Very soft bristles.  Good price,  This is a good buy if you want a good brush for washing your auto.",23,53
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,I used this a couple of times and it broke where you tighten the plastic piece to lengthen or shorten pole.,21,54
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Chose 5 star because of the quality and the other reviews on this product and it is made very well, sturdy,and affordable. My husband appreciated it since it will make his job washing the RV awning easier, etc.",38,55
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"the bristles are bent and so far do not straighten, I expect the product to arrive in good condition. If you have an idea to fix the problem fine, BUT as of now I would not re-order",37,56
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"I wash my car more often now, i don't known how I managed with out it . Great product. I recommend it.",22,57
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Reasonably well-made of metal (aluminum?) and plastic (nylon?).  Threaded onto the end of the handle is an extension that has a lever on it that you can slide from OFF to FULL.  Handy.  I keep it on the end of the hose at all times now.

Brush is soft.  It's easy to clean, too.  So you don't risk scratching the paint on the next vehicle you wash with road dirt from the last one.

We have three full-size vans.  Most of the time I clean them with one of those ""as-seen-on-TV"" car wash wands that has three water patterns and a soap dispenser.  If there's dirt that doesn't wash off with the soapy water, I use the brush.

Not much else to say, really.  It's a pretty simple device that's built well-enough to last a few years, maybe, if you're careful with it, but certainly not a lifetime.",148,58
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"The brush is very soft, so I felt comfortable using this to wash my car.  The brush is removable and every so often I would have to tighten it back onto the pole.",33,59
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"This item was made to last, sturdy not flimsy.  I would reccomend it be stored with the brush end UP since the bristles are thin
and would bend out of shape if left on the floor to dry.  Thin bristles = no marring of car finish and this is what we all hope for.",54,60
Automotive,B000ZLSF74,"Wish it were a little longer for my RV, but otherwise great.  What else can I say? I recommend it.",20,61
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,Fits on the Pedal (Brake and Clutch) but Breaks and Comes off again after a while.,16,0
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"Rode around with metal pedals for years!  These were cheap but they fit very well, and the pedals with pads on them look better.",24,1
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,I bought one for the brake and one for the clutch for my 76 CJ 5. Both snapped on with no problem and I have yet had one to come off.,31,2
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"This was a little hard to get on the brake pedal. Once on it was nice and tight, no problem with it coming off.",24,3
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,They're too small can't get them to fit. The pads I removed are bigger and different. I'll just keep them because I don't want to mess with the return.,29,4
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"My Jeep needed new ones for the brake and clutch.  I ordered two and promptly received them.  They fit perfectly and look stock.

I recommend this product.",27,5
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"Does not fit a 1949 Willys CJ3-A, which has pedals much wider than these pads.  Got to keep looking.",19,6
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,Not even close to fit my 1948 cj2a have to return them,12,7
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,perfect fit for clutch or brake of CJ5,8,8
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"fits like it should (on my 1983 CJ7). Nice and thick rubber, not cheap feeling at all.",17,9
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,Pad is a little thicker than original and also does not seem to be as tight on the metal.  I hope it holds up. Will post update if anything changes.  It went on my 1981 Jeep CJ7.,37,10
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,Fits my jeep CJ-7 brake pedal perfectly. I've ordered another for the clutch pedal,14,11
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"Finally I found these.....good fit and seem pretty durable for my 76 jeep cj5. One for the clutch pedal and one for the brake, they look as good as OE  equipment...good value !",33,12
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"Took some effort to get them on, but they are a great replacement for my 77 Jeep CJ-5.",18,13
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"Simple yet good product.  Used it to replace the clutch pedal on my 68 cj5.  It is pretty close, but not exact to the original, but for the price I am very happy with it",35,14
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,Worked fine in the 1980 CJ-5 that I had. Fit the factory pedal with no issues.,16,15
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"This prodect fits a Jeep 1979 Cj5 clutch pedal perfectly. Tricky to pry on, but worth it. Tight fit",19,16
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,"I had to take a razor and notch one side to fit clutch pedal, but fit well after that. Fit brake pedal great. (CJ-7 83)",25,17
Automotive,B000FQ7R32,Bought two of these for my 1979 Jeep CJ5 and they fit the brake and clutch pedal perfectly.  They went on well and have not slipped or moved at all.  Would recommend for anyone wondering if these fit or not.,40,18
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"I bought this radiator because of it's great reviews but after only two months the radiator is spraying coolant from the coils within it. Here is a picture to show what I mean. I thought it may be that my cap had simply gone bad and wasn't sealing, but after replacing it with a brand new cap I am still losing coolant that is spraying from within the radiator as demonstrated.

I'm not sure if I just got a rare bad apple of a radiator or perhaps you get what you pay for. It seems most other people had better luck with theirs.",103,0
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,I have always heard good things about koyo radiators. I put one in a car in February of this year. The radiator is leaking coolant all the way across the top where the plastic meets medal.,36,1
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,As of this date mine arrived in perfect condition and is the sought after koyo brand with a small  tyc sticker on the box. This is an incredible deal on a top of the line brand like koyo. Local auto parts stores are double the price and are cheaply made brands not near the quality of koyo.  Glad I found out about this deal from the miata forums they all seam to agree that this is the best replacement radiator for the miata.,83,2
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"This is a Koyo Radiator reboxed as a TYC, a great radiator at a great price. Works with automatics and manual transmissions.",22,3
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Gave 5 stars because it works. However neither a packing box nor a radiator itself had any mentioning of Koyo. It works, so who cares ))).",26,4
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,This is the closest thing you can get to an OEM replacement radiator for the NA Miata (1990-1997).  Why bother attempting to repair a radiator when you can buy a new one for under $100 shipped?,36,5
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Came nicely and safely packed in a Koyo box.  Very easy to install.  Only decision is how to handle the side rails.  You can either remove the mounting studs and mounting bolt grommets from the rails on your old radiator and install them on the rails on the new rad (will require some prying out of the old grommets and removing a C-clip for each stud, or, simply transfer the old side rails (studs and grommets and all) from your existing radiator to the new one using just 2 bolts each... either way, pretty easy.  Then you just transfer your existing fans from the old radiator to this new on (take the old rad and fans out of the car as one unit, makes it easier, 4 bolts per fan, and drop the new rad with the fans into the car .. nothing to it ... one of the most cost-effective and easiest improvements I've made to my '95 Miata .. I highly recommend this part!",166,6
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,I ordered one of these based on what I'd read on miata.net. Received a Koyo radiator in a Koyo box. Fit was perfect in my '91 with manual transmission.,29,7
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Someone on the Miata forum had mentioned they bought this TYC radiator and that it arrived in a Koyo box and with a Koyo part number so someone, for whatever reason, is branding them and selling them really inexpensively.  I used Koyo's extensively on refurbishing Miatas and never had one fail and was pleasantly surprised to see that this is a genuine product without even an attempt to disguise the packaging.  For the price it sells for on Amazon, it simply cannot be beat.",84,8
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,i don't know what tyc brand is but what i received was a koyo 1140 RADIATOR!! fit perfectly! you only need to keep two bolts from your old radiator that are held by c-clips and are what keep the radiator balanced in your miata! :D,45,9
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Direct replacement for a factory radiator with cracked upper tank.  All I work on is Miatas and this is my go-to radiator for stock replacement.  Good price, fast shipping, quality unit, OEM fitment with no issues.  I've probably installed over 20 of these and will continue to use them.",49,10
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,It fit like a glove in my '93 Miata.  I took longer to install than I had hoped but that was unrelated. I will no doubt be back in ten years to buy another.,34,11
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Great fit on 91 Miata 5-speed. One flaw to be aware of--the drain plug is terrible. Use a huge phillips head or even a butter knife to open it--the  plastic is super soft.,33,12
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"OEM fit, but its aluminum. The best of both worlds",10,13
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Fit perfectly into my manual 1993. Just had to transplant the hooks by removing/reinstalling the snap rings that kept them in place on the original radiator.,26,14
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Great replacement. Change your hoses now too. The transmission cooler connections stay capped and don't get in the way. Very pleased.  We'll see about long term.,26,15
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Installed very easily a few years ago and still works great, no complaints so far.",15,16
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Cured my overheating issues in a 1990 Miata. Holds more coolant than the OE manual trans radiator since it's designed for an automatic & needs the extra capacity for the transmission cooler. The drain plug is a huge step down from OE - it's made out of a soft plastic and is roughly sized for a #3 Phillips bit, unlike the OE which uses a #2 (or ideally the closest JIS size). Threads are different than the OE plug so unfortunately you can't re-use it.",85,17
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,I have bought two radiators from these guys and I love the quality. Exact fit for each radiator. One was a Vision brand (purchased 2 years ago) and the other was TYC. Maybe the same company but different name?,39,18
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Perfect fit on my 1997 M Edition Miata.  (Manuel transmission). Great product,12,19
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Cheap and effective.  I never had an cooling issues with this radiator and it has survived Texas summers.,18,20
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Exactly what I needed for my Miata, at half the price of the name brand. Perfect fit, slides right in and lines up with the fans perfectly; what more could you want!",32,21
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"This is the one to get for NA Miata. Perfect match to OEM, just swap over the rubber grommets. Fans fit exactly. Tip: make sure it's the one fulfilled by Amazon.",31,22
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Delivered very quick.  Mechanic friend had no problems installing along with new thermostat.  Price was great!,16,23
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Fit my 96 Miata just great!  Not that it's an issue, but be sure to save the mounting brackets from the old radiator.  This does not come with them.  Good thing I hadn't thrown out the old one yet before I realized it!",43,24
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"OEM quality, this radiator has been going strong for quite some time now.",13,25
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Put this in a 1990 Mazda Miata after the previous one decided to just start spontaneously draining its coolant all over the place. Installation was simple and this fit in perfectly, no problems with leaks or temperatures. Ended up selling the car and they haven't had any problems either. Probably good to note that the owner after me drove every day like he was autocrossing and it never overheated.",69,26
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Fit great but be sure to save the little bit parts when you remove the old one: they'll likely come in handy when you get the new one.,28,27
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Fit perfectly and does the job it was designed to do.,11,28
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Perfect fit for my 92 Miata with manual transmission, A/C, and power steering.",13,29
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,I did not receive the Koyorad radiator made in Japan that many of the reviews I read referenced to. Instead I received a TYC brand radiator made in China. I went ahead and installed it but based on the recent reviews posted on this radiator it doesn't look too promising.,50,30
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Perfect fit, easy installation, works as well as the old one!",11,31
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"This radiator looks to be well made but I believe the quality of the plastic tank is sub par.  Let me explain why.  Approximately 2 months after installing the radiator my head gasket wet out  (no fault of the radiator,  just bad luck)  and overheated the motor.  Afterwards I found the seating surface for the cap was deteriorated.  I believe this was from the overheating.  I have repaired the engine and cleaned up the seating surface as best I could (it does not hold pressure) and it runs cool and I have had no issues all summer.",97,32
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"JUNK, CROOKED. Brand came was TYC made in china. leaked by week 1 across the top.",16,33
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Decent quality radiator.  It appears at least as well made as the factory original from the outside.  Time will tell about the core itself.  It was an exact fit and easy install in my '97 Miata.  Everything lined up perfectly.  An hour drive at 95+ degrees outside with the AC blasting to test, and the temp gauge never crept above the low end of the normal range.",67,34
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Everything swapped across w/ no problems; radiator went in like OEM, and is working well. Was shipped in excellent condition.",20,35
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Perfect fit on my 1990 Miata. Can't beat the price. As others have noted, if you have a MT, just ignore the AT cooling section.",25,36
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Still a Koyo rad that comes in Koyo box that directly fits in my 94 when you order from Amazon. Keeping it cool in the AZ desert heat with average temps outside at 107 in July.,36,37
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Perfect fit for my application. Price was excellent. And deliver was in the stated time frame.,16,38
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Great price for Koyo radiator no problem install in 90 Miata 5-speed,12,39
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Bought as a replacement for my 97 miata 5 speed. Fits perfect and feels like oem quality at least. my car is completely stock and it keeps it at normal operation temperature. Not an experienced mechanic but was able to install in a couple of hours.,46,40
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Excellent fit.  Great price.  What more could you want.,9,41
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,It was very easy to install and fit perfectly. I used a how to video I found on YouTube to see how it was done and had the old one replaced in less that two hours.,36,42
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Packaged well. Smooth installation. Good fit. No leaks.,8,43
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"it works great and was easy to install. I can""t believe i installed it myself. Idon""t even change my own oil.",21,44
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Fit perfectly in 97 with manual trans, AC and PS.",10,45
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,fast shipping perfect for my 1994 Miata thank you what a life saver,13,46
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Mine showed up slightly out-of-square, but it still fit into the car (with just a bit of convincing,) and now I've got no more overheating problems. Excellent price for such a nice radiator.",33,47
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"the stopped the overheating cold.  It weights next to nothing.  Totally, totally pleased with this radiator",16,48
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,bought a project miata and turns out the radiator was halfway rusted so bought this for the amazing price of 70 and fits perfect in my 91. car running cooler now as well as expected,35,49
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,No complaints; works as advertised; fits my Miata perfectly; arrived in 2 days.,13,50
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"I received mine as a Lynol radiator, not Koyo like others have commented. It came with the automatic outlets, but I just left the plugs on those and it fit perfectly on my 5 speed with AC.

When I took the original radiator out, I measured the thickness to be about 16mm. This Lynol radiator was about 26mm and the fans sit nice and flush with the fins, so I'm getting a bit more cooling too!",76,51
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Read about these actually being Koyorad's on the Miata forums and decided to give it a try. Showed up in a brand new sealed Koyorad box with appropriate stamping on the radiator. It's a perfect fit when using factory radiator brackets, and took about 30 minutes to change. This is one of the best deals I've found as far as oem style radiator goes, and would definitely recommend buying this unit.",71,52
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"well worth the money, only complaint was one of the captive nuts was not threaded so one of the bolts on the side mounts was missing. i had to remove one from the old radiator and find a bolt for it. no biggie.",43,53
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,works great...replaced a radiator that was giving me problems only going uphill or on really hot days....very happy with this,20,54
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Perfect fit for my 92 Base Miata. After 21 years, the original radiator started leaking, bought this on Amazon and swapped it myself in less than an hour.",28,55
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"I am not a motorhead and this was my first radiator replacement. My son teamed up with me to make it a father-son project and we knocked it out and exactly one hour. Even for a couple guys that don't crank wrenches frequently, it was a piece of cake. The earlier comments that advised keeping the rails off the original radiator were spot on. That was the best advice I could have received and after swapping the rails, everything worked perfectly. There was nothing about this radiator that caused the problem, nothing needed special attention, modification or whatever. Everything just slid in perfectly. It was actually a lot of fun and a sense of accomplishment for a couple IT guys, father and son, messing around on a Saturday afternoon.",129,56
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"This is the factory Koyo radiator for auto or standard trans.  Perfect fit, same as my 24 year old, 104k mile original rad.
Manual trans leave the auto trans cooling tubes plugged, use your old mounts, goes right in. 5 stars! Bargain!",42,57
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,It is for the automatic transmission miata. I just capped off the transmission cooler hookups and the radiator matched up EXACTLY to my 1990 Mazda Miata 5 speed. Couldn't be happier!!!,31,58
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Comes with side rails, But I transferred my old rails since it was easier, I purchased through amazon warehouse and the box was beatup but the radiator was in good shape.",31,59
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,I forgot how much room I gave up with an oversized radiator.  Installing this gave me much more room to check belts and such.  It is of good quality.,29,60
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"It's not a performance radiator but a great OEM replacement. Ports were all in the right place, fins came undamaged, no leaks and mounting points matched stock... what else can you ask for? It even fit with no mods to my aftermarket cold air intake.",45,61
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,unfortunately I did not receive a koyo radiator but it was an exact fit! It has been several months now since I've dropped it in and have gotten no problems at all!,32,62
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Replaced my factory radiator on my 1993 Miata with this one.

EXACTLY the same! Everything bolted up perfectly and installed without issue.",22,63
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Oem radiator for dirt cheap. I bought thru amazon warehouse for 60 bucks and it's brand new with the exception of a few bent fins I meticulously bent back into place.,31,64
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Oem fit no problem, just switch the original 2 side brackets to new one and drop it in, everything fit",20,65
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"The dealer wanted 600 to replace. with a little patience and some garage tunes , this was actually fun to replace. everything fit well.
1994 Miata MX5",27,66
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Note: when I tried to order this for my 93 Miata, I kept getting a pop-up from Amazon that said it wouldn't fit my car, but I decided to trust some of the reviews that said it would.  It fit perfectly!",41,67
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Ordered Wednesday, arrived Friday using Amazon Prime from Amazon stock. It is in a Koyorad box marked ""Made in Indonesia, although I could find no markings on the radiator itself, just an ""inspected by"" sticker. Everything looks fine and I don't really care if it is ""genuine Koyo"" as long as it works. It really seems likely that all of the plastic parts are made in the same factory because how many Miatas are there in the world to support multiple sources?",82,68
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Just received and installed this on my '97. It's replacing a 5-year old Koyo radiator which clearly has a Koyo sticker branding on it, stating ""Made in Indonesia"". This new radiator has no stickers or branding; just some embedded letters indicating its model number, which makes me almost 100% sure that it's not a Koyo. The sealed box it came in has no branding or company name whatsoever, except model numbers and the words ""Made in China"". That being said, the build quality and materials seem EXACTLY the same as my Koyo. Fit is the same with one important consideration: I needed to use my cordless drill to slightly enlarge the two large holes that the locking pins go through on the side rails of the radiator, which end with an open lock washer. The stock pins were too large for the pre-drilled holes in the new radiator. Though it literally took 1 second to enlarge each hole, this still must be noted. I'm very happy with the radiator, price, quality, and overall value. The product would've been perfect except for the hole issue--which was an easy fix as long as you have a drill. I still highly recommend this radiator, though. Great buy.",204,69
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"This is the one that's just like the OEM, a perfect fit. It has the extra tubes for an auto transmission, don't worry about that though, you can only get auto transmission radiators for the early model Miatas any more, from anywhere I have seen.

Manual transmission owners just ignore the two extra tubes, no need to cap them off.",60,70
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Drop in fitment, just move over a little hardware. Works great, comparable to original factory radiator, except no leaks! Very shiny as well.",23,71
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Lowest price I could find, packaged well, working great. Installed very easily and included all hardware I required (some of my bolts seized and broke the clips when I took out the old unit).",34,72
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Yep like some others stated in their review, this TYC rad is a KOYO rad. Great price. Fit perfectly on my 97 miata 5sp. It will also fit on an auto.",31,73
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Fit & finish as expected, fit like a glove in the engine rails, and no worries to connect hoses. Working perfect.",21,74
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"Perfect fit, fast ship, just slip the grommets, lower stops, and cap from your old radiator and this one drops right in.",22,75
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"This is the best deal out there for a Miata radiator.  The box had a large gash in it from FedEx, but the radiator was fine.  It was a genuine Koyorad brand radiator.  The fit was perfect and it works great.",41,76
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"As other reviews say, this is a Koyo radiator for an amazing price. Installation was a breeze (follow the miata . net guide if unsure). It fits my '91 perfectly, and I now have a few hundred miles on it with no problems at all.
Only thing I would add is to use the old side rails from your replaced radiator instead of the shiny new ones attached to this replacement, as they have the grommets and mounting pins already in place.",82,77
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"High quality inexpensive replacement radiator for my 1993 Miata.  Dropped in with no problems, everything lined up perfectly. Highly recommended.",20,78
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"I was surprised to find this on Amazon, and even more pleasantly surprised to know that it could be shipped internationally. It took 4 days to arrive which is amazing and fit perfectly in my Miata.",36,79
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Best drop in replacement radiator for a miata you can buy. Works for manuals so if you are in need of an OEM replacement I would suggest this one!,29,80
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,Awesome product. Fits just like the O&M - maybe better.,10,81
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"just slid right in, no problems.  Have only had it in for about a 100 miles or so but everyone on the miata forum recommends them.  Good enough for me.",30,82
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,"As of April 2013 this is still a Koyo radiator. It was relatively easy to install and seems to be close to original OEM radiator in terms of quality.  A few of the fins were bent in (from shipping a presume) but not enough to affect performance.  I chucked the side rails that came with the Koyo and used the rails from the original radiator since they had the rubber grommets.and the koyo did not.  Also, the screw holes for the fans were not as precise as original radiator but with a little effort I was able to get them all in.  No radiator cap was included so keep the one from original rad, it was a perfect fit.  Haven't had a chance to drive much since installation but its doing its job so far.  Overall I am pleased with my purchase.",142,83
Automotive,B000IYPNC8,OEM fit 1995 1.8L miata with a good price.  i think i had to transfer some clips or fasteners from my current radiator to the new one.,27,84
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"I can't recommend this because it fell off.  It doesn't really have a way to attach to the wires, it just depends on the steal bits that make contact.  That does not work, as I discovered.",36,0
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"This clip made it extremely easy to replace a corroded end of a wiring harness.  The package includes both the trailer and and the vehicle ends of the wire.  It only took a few minutes to install, and most of that was getting the old wiring end off.  I only wish it had come with a dust cap to prevent future corrosion.  I ended up ordering one, also from Hopkins that has the test led lights right on the dust cover.",81,1
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"Easy to install. It can be reused. Great for making your own harness. Seven more required words, use heavier wire!",20,2
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"If you have to fix 4-way flat trailer wiring, this is a must have. Depending on where the damage is, you may be able to avoid having to splice in a new cable. It is especially handy when you need to replace the end on a T-connector, or if you just want to shorten one. No more messy splices. It is also a handy way to shorten the T-connector wiring when the wire to the 4-way connector is way too long. (I had 2' coiled up behind the bumper.)",89,3
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,This worked well for my needs. Easy to install and a little silicone gasket maker to the back and you'll have to worry about water or dirt getting into the wires and corroding them.,34,4
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,Product came quickly and fixed a trailer that we bought without having to splice the wires. This fixed a problem that i thought i would have to re-wired my trailer. Worth the investment.,33,5
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"I was very pleased to see how easily the connectors went together, using 16 and 18 AWG insulated wire. A small packet of silicon grease is included to help keep moisture from corroding the contacts. Used a pair of regular slip-joint pliers to assist in getting the protective cover to snap into position.",53,6
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"I mesh up my newly installed 4wire towing harness when it hit the roadside gutter and crush the end connector. I did not secure it at higher location and I just let it hang under the receiver. I thought I will need to replace everything, but when I tried to browse for a replacement, I saw this quick fix just for the ends. Cheaper and easier, rather than to replace everything. Only took me less than 2 minutes to fix the end connection.",83,7
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,Great Idea to keep in the back of your truck just in case.  Remember to have a pair of pliers to close it..,23,8
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"Self crimps just like the direction says... in order for this to work properly, you must be using the correct guage wire.",22,9
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,Just what I was looking for!  A great plug repair that can be done in the field in 5 minutes.  I plan to go back and actually solder the connections to make a permanent fix.  What's really neat is you don't lose any wire if you cut the old plug off flush at the base. I searched all over the internet for just this very thing and was pleased to find this.  So glad to not have joints midstream in the harness.,82,10
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"Awful.  Waste of money.  It might be good if you had exactly the gauge of wire that it was designed for and it would require that the jacket on the wire is also the perfect composition.  This was the second set that I tried and I am so completely disappointed.
Buy a wire kit and splice the wires...it works out so much better.  Quick Fix = Quick Headache",68,11
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"Quick and easy, but the wires are a little loose - hence 1 star loss.  Otherwise I'm happy with it.",20,12
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"Did the job, but it was hard to get pair of wires into the contacts and I don't expect this to be a permanent fix, the wires aren't securely held and it's not very weathertight. Good for an emergency repair and reusable for that purpose, but not what I'd call a professional or permanent repair.",55,13
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,Just what I wanted to replace the original connector which I had ground off when it fell on the ground while I was towing it.,25,14
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"I bought this because I thought this would be better than splicing.
It took a large amount of force to push my new trailer plug into an existing vehicle plug and I ended up bending all the pins 90 degrees on my first two attempts. One of the pins broke off shortly thereafter. Maybe the pins on this are a little larger then on my vehicle's plug.
Also the 48735 dust covers didn't stay on the plug without gluing.
Looks like I'm back to splicing.",85,15
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,I'm sure these connectors would work great with newer wire but if your wire has lost it's pliability forget these as an option. The wires will not stay after being compressed into the connector. If the wire terminators were a slightly thicker guage they may work better.,47,16
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"This worked great and was a breeze to install!  I don't see us using it permanently, but for a quick fix, this worked great and seems to be holding up just fine.  I may just leave it if it continues to hold up well - I suspect the wires themselves may be the weakest point.",55,17
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"This kit is exactly what it says it is - Quick Fix.  I expected this to be more or less an interim/temporary quick fix, however, high enough quality to provide a lasting permanent connection.  Using the silicon connection protector provided and some good quality tape - I used ZIP tape - I believe this will last for the long haul.",60,18
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"When the weather beats up the old one, I don't have to go and run a new wiring diagram. Using the new connector is very simple and easy. Through Amazon I am thankful for the convenience and the value.",39,19
Automotive,B000CMJS6I,"I have gone through two of these pieces.  Every time I take my trailer out I have to mess with it in order to get it to work.  Then they fall apart.  My current piece fell apart after only three trips out as a result of having to fix it each time I use it.  If you do buy this, solder the wire to the metal clips.  This is a very poorly made product but it is hard to find a replacement that is of better quality.",87,20
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"I bought a used car in Sept 2009 and during the winter/spring of 2010, I had trouble with the battery holding a charge. I recharged the battery many times during that period trying different methods to rejuvenate the battery until it would only hold a charge for a few days at best. I decided to just invest in a new battery when a friend told me about a battery additive he heard about many years ago. He didn't remember the product name so I searched the web and found this product on amazon. I decided to take one more shot to save the battery and ordered this product in May 2010. I added it to the battery and recharged the battery. The battery held the charge this time but I wanted to wait some time before declaring it a success. As of today, my battery is still going strong and I've had no dead battery situations since adding the Charge-It product. This product worked great for me.",167,0
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"Folks I can not prove if this product cures the sulfating  problem of batteries or not.  It is inexpensive enough and has been around since the early days 50s and 60s.  Who knows only time will tell.  I have had better results with Tesla chargers I am currently testing with some success on batteries over 20 AH.  If a battery is physically damaged, shorted or frozen there is no cure.",70,1
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"This stuff really works. It will extend the life of the battery by dissolving the sulfate build-up in your battery. The build-up of sulfation is the number one cause of battery failure. I used this in the past when it sold under the brand name VX-6 which is no longer sold. It works in lead acid batteries that can be re-filled. Naturally, you cannot use it in a 'sealed' battery. This is excellent stuff to totally clean the sulfation from the battery terminals too.
  This will NOT save a dead battery. I highly recommend this product. My only regret is that I did not buy the one quart size. The 2.5 oz. size is good for only one battery. It cost slightly more but you get over twelves times the amount.",131,2
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"I purchased 4 Recharge It kits from Auto Barn (one for each battery I needed renewed) and it has down the same as a product called VX6 that I had been using for over 20 years.

Automotive,B000AMBOA8,Product did not function as advertised! There was no voltage improvement after adding this product.,15,4
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"I purchased this stuff 10 years ago and put it in my wifes Suburban battery. The battery was a bottom of the line 2 year battery. I saw this sitting on the shelf and thought what the heck, for less than $3 (at the time) I can afford to give it a shot. The same battery still starts that Suburban even in freezing weather! Without a doubt, it is the best $3 I ever spent on a vehicle. I am about to buy a bottle to put in my Goldwing battery. Based on experience I anticipate the battery lasting at least 5 years. It is definitely worth the price!",109,5
Automotive,B000AMBOA8,"You use to be able to get this stuff at any parts store, but not anymore.  I guess they're trying to sell new batteries.

I'm in Florida where most batteries typically last about 3 years, with good ones going lasting just over five.  I've used this in two vehicles and had the batteries last more than 7 years.  These were in vehicles parked outside and not hooked up to battery maintainers.  If you're into chemistry, check out the MSDS for Charge-It and you can work out the reaction.",102,30

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This Motorola dual charger gets the job done.  I previously had a Motorola auto charger that had a single micro USB output.  It worked pretty well; however, the cable wasn't detachable -- if you didn't have a micro USB input on the device you were trying to charge, you were sunk.

This dual charger, which does include a USB to micro USB cable, provides much more flexibility.  Not only can my wife and I charge our phones at the same time, but we can swap out the cables and, using other cables, charge our daughter's Nintendo DS, etc.

The charger will top off our phones (Samsung Galaxy SII) pretty quickly.

It seats securely in the 12 volt outlet and has an LED indicator to show the electrical connection with the car is in effect.

In all, it's a fine charger.  The detachable cable makes it easier to store and gives it the flexibility that many people need given the broad assortment of gadgets in our lives these days.  Because it has two outlets, it lets those of us swimming in gadgets to keep them charged.",185,0
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The feature I think that is best about this charger is that I've verified it has enough current to charge an Apple iPad. A lot of these cigarette lighter adapters don't have enough wattage for tablets - being useful only for cellphones and other small devices. But on this one, both outlets are putting out enough wattage for the tablet. Of course, you can still use it for lower wattage items such as music players, etc.

One negative is the big box it comes in. It just seems unnecessary to have so much packaging for something so simple.  The box is actually around the same size as the box an iPhone comes in!",113,1
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The jury is out on this charger.  The website claims 850mA out of each port but the charger has ""Output: 5V 750mA"" printed on it.  It does not specify whether the 750mA is the total output or the output of each port.  Since the website is not consistent with what is printed on the charger, I'm not sure you can trust the specs at all.  The input power claims to be 10-33V @ 1000mA so one would assume to draw that much power (over 10 watts), the device should be able to produce 750mA out of each port or 1.5A total (5V @ 1.5A = 7.5W) but I did not test it to determine the maximum current output.  I may do so at a later time.

It did my Droid 1 and charge my HTC Rezound at the same time.  The white LED is overly bright and you may find it offensive at night, depending on where your cigarette lighter jack is located on your vehicle.

I gave this 3 stars because I feel there are better dual chargers available for less and the specs were not consistent with what the website claims.  As a side note, this charger includes a micro USB sync cable.",205,2
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I like that the cord unplugs from the charger unit to give you a full sized USB on one end and the micro usb on the other. It seems like a well built piece as opposed to some of the more flimsy car chargers. I've got a couple of Mophie charging packs and they take the micro usb so it's always handy to have multiple options for charging.,68,3
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"While this car charger may be more expensive than some of the alternatives you're looking at, it's also better.  Much better.  Most USB car chargers provide around 500mA power total, which may or may not even be enough to power your GPS depending on which phone you have.  Most USB dual car chargers split the 500mA power among the two ports, leaving them with 250mA each (definitely not enough).  This unit provides you with 850mA on EACH port, for a total of 1700mA.  I don't think that you'll find a better unit in existence.  You can charge your Atrix at the same time your friend charges his iPhone.  Or any other devices that can charge over USB.  All from one 'cigarette lighter.'  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a car cell phone charger, especially if you may ever need to plug in two 'smartphones' both at the same time.",152,4
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The Amazon description says this charger is rated for 850mA, but the label on the charger says 750mA. I have no way to measure that, so decide who you want to trust.

Most car chargers are only 500mA. If you are using your phone's GPS navigation in your car, 500mA may not be enough to keep the battery from running down. 750mA should be adequate to charge your battery and run the GPS navigation at the same time. Two sockets is a nice bonus if you're charging two devices at the same time.

The charger conveniently comes with a microUSB cable, which is standard on modern phones other than Apple. If you have an Apple device, you need to provide your own cable.

Price on this charger is very expensive compared to 3rd party chargers that claim to do the same thing. Should you save your money? If your Motorola smartphone has a $600 replacement cost and you're worried about a no-name charger voiding your warranty, then I suppose this Motorola charger is worth the price. Or you could wait for it to go on sale again.",187,5
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"For those of us increasingly dependent on our mobile devices, a car charger is very handy.  If you're buying a new one, you might as well get a dual-port model for the inevitable time when your passenger's device also needs charging.  Or you get a tablet.  Or...

This unit is a lot bulkier than my old single-port Sprint model, but because it protrudes further, it's easier to find in the dark, and I can see the bright LED light between the two ports; the old charger's light would be obscured by the cigarette lighter's cover-flap, in my Honda Civic EX.

Many chargers seem to not include a cable, so the short microusb one included in this kit is very welcome, since I like to keep a cable in each of my travel bags, as well as in each of car/office/home/workplace.

A car-charger is very valuable for today's power-hungry short-lived smartphones.  This one is a good choice, and handily includes a cable.  Recommended.",162,6

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Best car charger ever!!!! Charges quickly and has added convenience for your passengers as they can charge their phones at the same time. Would recommend and buy again. Suggest buying a 6ft cable for passengers in the rear that need to charge.,42,19
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"It is still working.  Great idea so you can charge more than one device, or so the passenger can navigate while the driver's phone can still be charging.",28,20
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This charger is excellent!  I bought one for a road trip last fall to keep my Android charged while navigating too... GPS really sucks up those trons.  At our destination the phone was still charged, not dead like the older slow rate charger would have it.  Both ports are are the fast speed charge ports, this was the important part.  It was hard to find one of these that was good for charging two Androids rather than one Android and one Apple product and had a good rating, well here's another.  Loved this so much I bought one for the wife for my birthday, yes I said for for her for my birthday ;)",114,21

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,bought this a long time ago and still going strong,10,33
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Great charger for my Motorola Atrix 2!  Used other cheap $5.00 chargers that gave my first Motorola Atrix 2 a shorter life because they where unregulated and burned up the phones charging circuit. Going to purchase only name brand chargers for my smartphones from now on.,46,34
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Doesn't work that well for the new Phones. Slow recharging. Not quick charge here.,14,35
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Perfect USB car charger. Works great with Apple devices with your Apple USB cable. I read some people are having problems with other non-apple chargers and Apple devices.,28,36

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,works great to provide a dual usb connection in the car with limited 12v connections. Worked like a champ to keep both the kids Nexus 7s running while on a long road trip.,33,41
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Still works more than 18 months later. The little led light is a little annoying.,15,42
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,It does NOT stay in the lighter socket and pops out frequently all by itself.,15,43
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This is perfect when you have multiple devices from different vendors,11,44
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"It works. Handy little car charger, and durable. I've had mine for quite a wile and use it all the time. I charge everything with it, from MP3 player to my iPhone, it works.",34,45
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Wow!, I'm still surprised with the performance of this product with the car's energy. Is awesome!
I bought this product on June 2013 and is still working.",27,46

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I ended up buying 2 of these and boy am I happy I did.  We have electronics everywhere nowadays and I really needed a good charger for the car because the Verizon one I purchased was absolutely worthless as always.  I am glad I finally ventured outside of the Verizon store.  They make you think it's the only charger right for your phone.  NOT SO!!!  As soon as I got it I tried it out and boy does it charge fast!  I really hope it lasts a long time!!!

GREAT CHARGER!!!!  VERY HAPPY SO FAR!!!!!!",95,53
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Great connection. There is a light on it to show it has power. The angle design is a great idea.,20,54
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The dual charging function is an awesome feature, as is the fact that it's an actual brand (I've read all the horror stories about non-brand chargers).

If you are only charging one device only use one cable, otherwise it will divide the available charge (your phone will charge at half the potential speed)

I have a Samsung GS4. When resting the phone charges reasonably fast, low-energy apps (YouTube) will charge slowly, high-energy apps (GPS) will maintain battery life and maybe charge a little depending on how far you're driving. HOWEVER, if you're attempting to charge two devices and use GPS the phone will still die, just at a slower rate.",110,55
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I purchased this item so two devices could simultaneously be charged.  My passenger and I required our cell phones to be charged during our 6 hour drive.  Secondly, it provides for secondary power to a tablet.",36,56
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I really like this charger, both my wife and I can charge our phones at the same time which us helpful.",21,57
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This is a great option to extend one outlet to two outlets.  We're pleased with the price and quality of this purchase.,22,58
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Pretty cool way to charge two things at once, be it two phones or a GPS unit or what have you.",21,59
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,The charger looks good and can handle two devices at the same time. Much cheaper comparing to other brands. No complaint about it.,23,60
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I'm done buying generic chargers. They end up being bad values. This charger works for my iPhone, so I'm happy.",20,61
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Took this to Hawaii so me and my friend could charge (or keep charged) our phones in our rental car.  Charged my phone quickly.  Going to purchase a second one to keep in my truck.,35,62
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,My old charger went out This is such a great replacement. although I didn't expect a detachable cord i can adapt..Great product.,22,63
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I purchased both Motorola's Dual Port Wall Charger (SPN5689A) and Dual USB Car Charger (P617) which combine to give me a convenient set of charging devices that travel with me everywhere and cover me anywhere!,35,64
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Works great for two iPhone's, I have a 4S and my wife a 5S and we charge both at the same time with this. Works great.",26,65
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The rapid car charger is a tool that not only served at Motorola, but it works with all brands. Being USB I can dismantle it quickly ...",27,66
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,We just received this car charger and have only used it once so far.  So I really don't have enough use on it yet to really rate this product fairly. We like that we can use two usb cables due to the 2 different phone connections we have. So now we can plug in both our phones at the same time.,61,67
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,The only reason I gave it a 4  instead of a five is I haven't tried it yet. I do believe however it will be perfect for our motorcycle trip this year where we will be camping a lot. With this we should be able to keep our phones charged as well as our Garmin while on the fly so we won't have to worry about electrical hook ups at our campsites.,72,68
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Well built, works well.  Much more stable output than 'cheap' adapters.  The dim LED light is a GREAT design as it doesn't distract at night (like many other adapters do).  The only con is that it is a bit long.  Definitely the best adapter I have used, though.",48,69
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Works well, I love the fact that it is able to charge two gadgets at the same time.. No problems with the connections.",23,70
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Plug any device into it and it works just fine. Easy and simple. Works well with multiple devices. Would buy again.,21,71
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The cord was either wrong or bad quality, the charger did did not work. I replaced the cord with another one and the charger started working.",26,72
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Not particularly ""rapid"", but it does charge my galaxy 4 with no problem.  I also tried it with the galaxy and an mp3 player plugged in at the same time. Both charged.",32,73
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This is perfect.  Can charge two devices at once.  Anything that connects via USB.  Can charge my bluetooth and phone at the same time or my tablet and phone.,29,74
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Timely shipping and received package in good condition.

The overall feel of this charger seems to be of a nicer quality than most.
Better plastic shell and the 12v pins aren't flimsy metal like most.
This did have the hologram leading me to believe this is a genuine Motorola product.

I believe it's rated at 750 ma so it's not a high output charger but it charges my older Samsung smarthphone while phone is in use.  Small light on charger reminds you that it's drawing current from you auto battery.

Product performs as described and I'm satisfied.",97,75
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"It charges fast which I like. However, if I am charging my phone while playing music on it it makes a really obnoxious high pitched ringing.. it was so annoying that I had to unplug it from the charger after about 10 minutes... luckily it had charged enough that I could do so..",53,76
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,It is nice and sleek and I really like having 2 USB ports as opposed the 1 I had with my last charger.,23,77

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I purchased this item to use in my car in order to charge both my phone and my wife's at the same time.  Initially it worked great and would charge the phones with no problem.  After a few months, the bottom plug wouldn't charge at all and I assumed the charging cable for it didn't work.  Shortly after that, both ports would no longer charge at all and I could actually watch my phone drain while it was plugged up.  This despite that fact that the charging icon was showing that the phone was charging.  I took both USB cords that come with the charger and plugged them into the USB ports on my computer and found that the cords worked fine...the actual charger died.  I'd recommend going with another brand if looking for a longer lasting charger.",138,80
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Always need to charge two items in the car.  This works well and charges relatively fast.  Fits nice in the socket.  No complaints.,23,81
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,The Motorola P617 Rapid Dual USB Car Charger with Micro USB Data Cable that I just got from Amazon.com works like a charm ... two usb ports will charge two phones at the same time ... it charged my Droid from 16% to 100% in 40 minutes ... much faster than the cheap charger I had been using ... I'm sold ...I recommend this one,65,82
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,On older cars such as mine we only get 1 car charging port in the car with no Aux ports. This is a great way to double the amount of devices you can charge. It is high quality and very durable. I highly recommend this product.,46,83
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Motorola P617 Rapid Dual USB Car Charger with Micro USB Data Cable has been in use x 1 week and works great so far. {replacing an Ionic Car unit that unfortunately failed after only 4 months!].,36,84
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I was happy to find a rapid charger that didn't come with a cord attached. It makes for much easier storage.,21,85
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This little gem of a charger is GREAT!! It charges super fast and makes no noise!! And, most importantly, it saves on space and it doesn't kick off any fuses or anything. Love it!!!!",34,86
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This car charger is exactly what I was looking for and the price was right.  If I had purchased from the phone store it would have been at least double the price.,32,87
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Worked great until one day just stopped working with no warnings. Worked great the first two months until it broke.,20,88
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is the only type of charger I will buy, the ones that use a USB cable seem to last much longer than the ones that have the cord hard wired.",31,89
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I ordered this charger because I wanted a dual car charger because I have two phones. Only one of the ports would work.,23,90
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Love the fact that it came with a data cable and that I can plug in two normal USB cords into it. Had trouble finding one that had to holes that one wasn't for an Apple charger. Works great, couldn't be happier.",42,91
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I bought this to charge my LG G2 phone and company blackberry. It works well and has enough power to charge my LG G2 even while I'm using the phone for GPS with the screen on and streaming Pandora. The white led light on the front has a very narrow ""beam"" which is nice, because it doesn't blind you while driving down the road at night unlike some other junky flashy chargers I've used.",74,92
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Great item. It was delivered and and unpacked with ease.  As described and gets the job done. Happy with the item.,21,93

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"It charges fast..
However depending on your car, if you have it plugged in near your manual or automatic ""stick"" the adapter sticks out to far and you will bump it.

I recommend putting in in your arm rest if thats an option. Or get a low profile charger.",49,100
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The thing worked well. The driver and passenger didn't come to blows during a long road trip over charging the phones. Life, the trip and the charger were fine.",29,101
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This charger is compact and sturdy.  Well worth the extra few dollars to get this charger over the $2 ones I was looking at.  Dual USB ports allow me to charge my android phone while my wife charges her iPhone.  Charge speed is moderate, but is able to keep up when I have GPS Navigation running.",56,102
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,With a rapid charger in the car I definitely notice a difference compared to the generic chargers. With most electronics nowadays you want to ensure if you close to a charger that you are charging your device. With the rapid charger I can charge my phone much faster and have the extra usb port for any other devices in the car.,61,103
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I wish this had come in a smaller size.  I have a coupe and want to plug it in my center console port but it will barely fit and forget plugging anything into it, now it really won't fit.  I will end up using it but I have to remove parts of my car from the center console to get it to work.",63,104
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This charges my Droid much faster than the one that Verizon sold me with the phone (which costs over $30) and it has a 2nd USB port if you need it.  Not much to think about here.... get it,39,105
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,take it out of the package plug it in and it works great.  The data cable works with my Bluetooth Motorola and also my LG smartphone.,26,106

super helpful i recommend it to everyone",31,107
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I one of these for each car I loved it so much, fits and charges anything that plugs into USB, the led is bright and the construction is solid. If I needed another dual charger, I wouldn't hesitate to get another one",42,108
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,If the orientation (shape) was made sleeker...... I would have given it 5 stars. Works great.... just too bulky and big.,21,109
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Works great, and I'm able to charge 2 phones or I-Pods off 1 charge. Which is awesome for vehicles with limited outlets and multiple items that need charging.",28,110
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I've had a couple of electronic devices ruined by cheap chargers (I think that was the culprit) so I stick to well known brand names.  I haven't had it for very long, but it seems very well built and to be working well.  The peace of mind to know that it's a big brand name is worth a few bucks to me for something that is going to have such expensive items potentially damaged by using a bad one.",79,111
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This is a great charger. Works every time don't have to keep adjusting it for it to make better electrical contact. Now two phones can be charged simultaneously. No more argument of who should charge first. Very pleased with my purchase.,41,112
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I love this dual USB charger. I was pleasantly surprised to find a USB charging cord included in the shipment. I didn't realize that was part of the package. I'd ordered an off-brand one that was cheaper and it didn't work. They were very kind and refunded me my money including shipping. But this one works perfectly and I love the way the two slots are at an angle. Now I can charge my Phone and my Bluetooth at the same time or my Tablet. lol I have choices I don't have to just charge one thing. and wait. This item is a must have if you have more then one devise that needs charging. I'm a bit curious if it'll heat up if I plugged my laptop into it. I'll have to try it the next road trip I take :),142,113
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,It worked on my HTC but not on my wife's DRIOD. The cable fit but it would not charge the phone,21,114
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Two USB chargers takes only one  cigarette lighter jack. It will be perfect if it could be just a little bit shorter. The center storage box is a too small making it harder to plug in USB cables.,38,115
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This works perfectly and charges my phone faster than the wall charger even. I really liked the quality of the Micro usb cable that came with it.,27,116
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"works fine for me, but the USB cord that came with it didn't work at all.  may as well have not sent the UBS cord.",25,117

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"As some other users reported, the USB cable does not work with my Motorola Razr Maxx despite it being labeled a Motorola product. This USB cable isn't the one with a hologram on it, it has white picture tags that have an X through the laptop and mobile phone pictures.

I personally don't mind the light on it. I know it's working when lit.",100,119

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Bought this to charge our iPhone 5 while on the road.
Works great, fits securely into the lighter socket and it is a lot cheaper than the Apple car charger.",30,122
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This product came with a usb cord with what looks like an audio jack split out on the other end. Worthless cable, doesn't charge. Thankfully I had one I could use at home already.",34,123

It is good and fully chaged my MAXX but seller gave me defect cable which does not work.",36,127
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"No complaints here.  Seems much more sturdy and heavy duty than the cheap car chargers I used to buy in the checkout like at Walgreens or Target.  Those usually fall apart or just quit working entirely.  This thing seems like the real deal though, and after a few months of use it's still going strong.

It has 2 USB inputs that work just great when used together.  Fits securely into the lighter and not loose at all.  It has a nice white (but not distractingly bright) indicator light that tells you if it's plugged all the way in.

Currently using this with my iPhone 4, and it has also worked charging the wife's iPhone 5 (simultaneously,) even after iOS 7 update.  Would definitely recommend this charger to anyone.",128,128
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,It works just fine.  I wanted a different one but wanted to be conservative with the cost so it's working fine.,21,129

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"very good and intuitive design but I don't think it pumps enough juice to charge two fones.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"So far, good quality. I've been using it a month or so and it's still working fine. I'll update if it ends up killing on me like most of the chargers I've bought in stores lately.",36,135
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is a very good product. wanted to give 5 stars but just cant, there was only 1 disappointment with it, the usb cord that comes with it doesnt work. thankfully i had my old motorola charging cord and it works great. a minor thing that is of no big importance, the product description says that it comes with a warranty card, there is no warranty card but for the price ill just buy a new one if needed.",79,136
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Charges fast and works on my cell phones and tablets. Perfect for older vehicles prior to having USB. I have bought a 2nd one for a friends car,28,137
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Cell phone didn't come with car charger or usb cable. 2nd cell came with usb cable but also no car charger. Two usb ports make it possible for my wife and me to charge both phones with our 2 cables while on a trip.,44,138
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I've used this for almost a year and had no problems with it with my Motorola Droird Razr phone. It has sat in my car this whole time. I use it about once every 2-3 weeks, usually to keep my phone from running out of battery when using GPS. My phone also has no issues over that period of time.

It's been almost another year in about a month and still working as it did before.",76,139
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"usb car charger works properly, but the included micro usb cable doesn't.  charger works fine with other micro usb cables i have.",22,140
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this charger works pretty well and fast! charges extremely fast when it's only one phone, but if you have two plugged, takes a bit more. if you're using your phone with gps or streaming music, the charger is enough to not let your battery level go down though.",48,141
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,The cable that came is a Motorola Audio and Power USB Cable SKN6394A. Not as decribed or shown in the photos. I guess I'll try it. Hopefully my phone won't explode.,31,142
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I often have multiple gadgets to plug in while I'm in the car so I purchased this charger to help with that.  No more fighting over the socket!  It also came with a really long usb cable that I like to use to charge my phone inside too.  I can plug it in and wrap it around my bed post to keep it from falling off at night while it charges.  It also came with an auxillary cable.  I'm not sure that was supposed to be included because it wasn't mentioned in the ad, but useful anyway!  Seems to charge fairly rapidly compared to other car chargers I've used.  Overall, good buy.",112,143
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is a sturdy charger and can feel actual Motorola finishing (not like a fake one). After blowing 3 car charger fuses with previous low quality car charger, I have decided to go for this one and I should say, I'm really satisfied with this one.",46,144
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Using it and it is working properly. Don't need to specify anything more as it is universal charge and work as designed.,22,145
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"very perfect, light, easy to carrier I high recomended for any cell phone easy to share with anyone you can plug any car",23,146
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I use it with my Samsung GS4 IBolt car dock. Works fantastically and does not pop out of the car charger (my last one the internal springs wore out and fell out of place, hence the adapter would constantly pop out)...hope it lasts as long as the previous one did! The two ports is so convenient for letting my lowly IPhone-user-friends plug in since their batteries are always dying ^___^ (works with IPhone, my Droid BIONIC, and my Galaxy S4)",80,147
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This product works well and charges my Droid 2 and my wife's iPhone.  Just what we needed.  The design is a bit big and bulky for the application.  Several of the other models were the same size as the DC port.  Motorola needs to re-think the design.,47,148
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is an excellent car charger and can be used for multiple units (smart phone, kindle, tablets, etc.). It comes with micro USB cable and 3 position audio/video cable. Excellent price and shipped promptly by vendor.",36,149
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,2 out of 2 orders resulted in a defective micro-USA data cable.  The charger seems to work since I used an alternate cable that I had in my arsenal.  Whoever is manufacturing this cable for Motorola obviously doesn't have strict quality control guidelines.  I don't have the confidence that a 3rd purchase would yield better results.,56,150
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The best I can get out of it is to keep my phone at the same percentage it was when I plugged it in, regardless of how long it stays plugged in. My drive home is about 45 minutes and if I plug my phone in at 50%, it will remain at 50% for my entire drive home. Whether the screen is on or off, whether I talk on it or not, whether I plug in one device or two.",80,151
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"All connections fit well and it does the job. Haven't had it long, but do not see any reason it shouldn't last a long time.",25,152
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"It was more then what it looked like online. It is bigger then the pic looked, but the right size. It works great and love that it came with a usb cord and 2 slots. Fast shipping. I will be ordering more products from these guys again. Order from them, you won't be disappointed.",54,153
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This Moto dual car charger (P617) arrived promptly & is exactly as described.  It says Motorola on it with the hologram & everything, so my guess is that it is original, not some knock-off as expressed by some others.  It is a charger with dual ports & comes with 1 detachable USB wire w/ micro plug.  I am not an electrician, but it says it puts out 850ma per port, which means it will charge most Smartphones, cell phones & Tablets quickly.  The home-charger for my Moto Droid Razr M has an output of 850ma also, so it's a good match & pretty fast.  And at around $7...instead of $20-$25...it's a good deal.  It might not work for every cell phone out there (like iphone) or fit every car lighter perfectly, but nothing will.  I recommend it!",137,154
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This is a rapid charge car charger that I put in one of my vehicles.  I wanted to make sure that I had a car charger for each of my cars so that I didn't have to worry about carrying one everywhere with me.  It works great and I am very happy with it.,54,155
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I truly like the convenience of the Motorola Dual Charger. It allows you to charge two devices at once. The only drawback is that I sometimes leave it on when I'm not charging my phone. I wish the indicator light was on the side where it would be easily viewable. I like the fact that it uses the straight wires instead of the coiled. Therefore it is more likely to have a smooth direct charge. No shortage! I highly recommend this charger to everyone. Just hope you are better at remembering to unplug it than me!,96,156
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,i love it this charges fast looks nice and i like the fact that it can charge two not just one phone,22,157
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"My wife and I kept both our phones (Motorola Razr M) fully charged during a long road trip using this charger.  It came with one USB cable and I separately bought an additional cable so both phones can be plugged in at the same time.  No issues, no complaints, works great, and so much less expensive here than elsewhere!",59,158
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,The cable that came with this product has images that suggest it is not for phone charging or use in a computer.  It is a nonstandard cable that has weird connections involving an audio jack.  This is not what I ordered and not what was pictured in the advertisement for the product.,52,159
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This Motorola adapter is good solid quality. I didn't need the Micro USB Data Cable, although, but the price was right.",21,160
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"well after returning the first charger for the same reason i realized that the cord provided will not charge either of our cell phones - however, if you use a different cord it works just fine.  Not sure the issue with the cord that comes with it as both the phones we are trying to charge are Motorola phones and it is a Motorola charger.....  Will keep the second one just for the charger but trash the cord !!",79,161
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Charger works as expected, seems to be original Motorola made. Have used it only a handful of times but charges rapidly.
I would recommend this seller and product.",28,162
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is exactly what I needed. My fiance and I do a good bit of traveling in the car and I have a Galaxy SIII and she has a Stratosphere II and charging both our phones has been a struggle. This charger charges both phones at an extraordinary rate at the same time. Even with the new Google Maps app which sucks the life out of my battery it still charges my phone while I have the gps on, full screen brightness, and playing Pandora.

Awesome product that I would recommend to everyone.

The only con is the ridiculous white power indicator which shines like a headlight in the car but I just took a black sharpie to it and now I'm happy.",123,163
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I have been using this charger for a year and it still works great I use it to charge my ipod and phone together and it works wonders.,28,164

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This charger works great!
I can charge both phones without overheating this device or my phone.
have been use it for more than 2 weeks, works well, no complaint!",29,166
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Much better... Works great! I will purchase again. Just like described. I use it with my RAZR.! What else do I put here?,23,167
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,While I am pleased with the USB charger the cable did NOT work with my Droid phone.  It appears as though this is not a Motorola cable.  I had to order a separate cable from Motorola.,36,168
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"this is the second one of these i have purchased.  i still have my first one, and after a year it still works just like it is suppose to.",29,169
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Using it to charge my personal and work phone at the same time. It's working out exactly as i needed it to. Well worth the price.,26,170
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Excellent product. It really charges my phone while I am driving. It looks and feels like a quality product.  Recommended it!,21,171
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Works great to charge multiple devices.
Good price, great for vacation. I would buy again
if another one is needed.",20,172
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I wish I could say I have this still, the day after I used it once, someone stole it from my car.  I'm sure it would have worked great.  I liked the thought of having dual usb ports.",38,173
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This product is the top of the line . If you want the best , then this is the one !!",21,174
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Bought this for the family car to charge HIS and HERS cellphones (Android and IPhone) whenever we are out. Love the compact design, elegant, yet functional.  Seems to charge both phones very quickly simultaneously.",34,175
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Works as intended, rapid charge, small white led when on- looks nice and is the same color as most newer vehicles interior lighting- nice and soft at night unlike the bright red LEDs so common to phone chargers. Comes with a cable, get a second cable for your passengers, it's a great product, at the best price. Thanks again Amazon.",60,176
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Just what I needed. I use it to charge my phone and nexus. It arrived quickly and works great. No other charger is needed for me.,26,177
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"really great value and idea by motorola. i have two phones, so this allows me to charge both at once. it's can be a little bulky with both cords, but i just store in glove compartment until i need a charge :)",42,178
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Got this to replace a cheap charger, and this thing works like a charm. It is a rapid charger and comes with two USB ports. Charged me and my sisters phone with this charger.",34,179

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I got this to replace my previous phone charger. At first I was about to buy the same one but I noticed this had 2 ports! So I ordered and extra usb cable as well along with this and it easily charges 2 devices at once with out issue. Only thing is that if you leave it plugged in the little while LED stays on (its hardly noticeable, even at night), it doesnt bother me I just leave it plugged in, but it might some.",85,181
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Perfect for my long drives, able to charge both phones or the kindle and ipod.... Have had no problems with this at all and it's great that I got an extra cable with it as well.",36,182
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I bought this mostly as an 'emergency' charger to have in my car, so I haven't used it a lot. I did test it out, though, and it seemed to work well. I did have a little trouble getting it to stay in my outlet; I ended up having to rotate it a little to get it to stay in.

It brought my Droid RAZR MAXX HD (with the 3300 mAh battery) from 46% to 64% in about 35 minutes or so.",82,183
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I love the little white light that this car charger has. I don't know why. Totally better than the classic red or green though. My favorite part is the fact that it takes USB cables! And two of them at that! This has been really durable for me. It seems like it wil last a long time, I got this like a year ago and still looks and acts brand new. Highly recommend!",73,184
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,i was needing to be able to charge more than one thing at a time. So this was my answer to our charging needs. Since we all know how smart phones always need charging.,34,185
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I purchased this to charge my cell phone & bluetooth when on the road.  So far no complaints works well & charges quickly. The order also arrived much qukickly than i expected. I would order from this company again.,39,186
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Very nice to be able to charge two phones at the same time!. Seems to work well. Plus, when a cord breaks, I can just replace a standard cord with the charger part still working. A big plus!!",38,187
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I really like that it has the angled dual port because I can't use the straight port in my car because of where my plug is. The charger works great, though!",31,188
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This has a 750mA output which is nothing compared to what most smartphones consume.  I bought this in hopes of using to power two smartphones, however it just barely charges them.  In 30 minutes I might see a 4% increase in charge, vs. my basic Motorola charger that will charge my phone at least 20% in the same time.  For a basic phone, this might work great, but look elsewhere for charging a smartphone.",74,189
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Works just as described. Fast delivery. Just what we needed for two Motorola phones.
Pilot light shows when on. Fits easily into console. Includes one cable with Micro Data Cable.
That's a plus for me.",35,190

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I bought this Motorola car charger for my new Defy XT smartphone.  It worked as expected right out of the package.,21,193
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"One of the best smartphone accessories I've purchased.
Though another reviewer felt the light was too bright for night driving, i didn't feel that way. Besides, you can easily mask it.",31,194
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is just what I was looking for. Charger supplies ""AC"" charging current to my Droid RAZR HD from either socket for fast battery charging and plenty of power even if using navigation or other battery-draining apps. It works nicely with a Wilson ""Sleek"" Cell Signal Booster plugged into the other socket. I can power both units at the same time from one outlet. Fills the bill perfectly. It is not completely compact compared to other units out there, but it's not huge either. The sockets being offset a little is nice. The LED is bright, but the charger can be rotated so that the light is not directly visible. Also nice to have an extra USB charging cord since it's easy to lose them, or just to have a spare. For around $9, this is a no-brainer. Very satisfied with this charger.",143,195
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This is a cost effective way to charge cell phone and listen to IPOD.  I recommend this over buying directly from Verizon.,22,196
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,No problems... was exactly as I expected and works fine...  Good price and buy.  Remember to order a cord with it...,21,197
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"works as expected.  More words do not come to mind.  Filling space with required words.  Silly procedure, just to fill",20,198
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This charger is phenomenal. I love that it has 2 USB ports for both driver and passenger devices. Plus it's eco friendly! You can't go wrong with this travel charger. I recommend purchasing this for your vehicle.,37,199

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This charger does its job. I have had no problems to date. Would recommend to anyone using the Motorola phones.,20,203
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Genuine Motorola charges phone & bluetooth at the same time.  Works as advertised. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",20,204
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Works well with Motorola Defy. Very affordable and has  good set of features for the price. I would recommend if you are looking for a car adapter,27,205
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I was using an ac/dc converter with an outlet and using the wall charger in my car since I didn't want to get the car charger for my phone, plus, this just makes more sense for charging more than one usb device at a time.",45,206
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Giving it a five star rating because it is exactly as it is described.  The device is good quality, very good construction, won't break, wish they had it with the USB side by side, not on top of each other, might make it a little less footprint.  That is being very critical, so I give it five stars because it is a very good product.",65,207
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Inexpensive alternative that can hook up two separate USB chargers, say iPhone 5 and iPhone4, at the same time. Fits right and works great.",24,208
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,A car charger that just does the job.  It comes with a cable that can also be used for connecting to a computer.  It's nice to have this option instead of just having a charger that can only be used in the car.,43,209
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Bought this based on the reviews.  When I received it, part of the body had been clearly sanded to remove some kind of flaw in the plastic so it was all scratched up.  Yet there was a protective piece of plastic on the front face where the ports are to prevent that from getting damaged.  Made no sense.

The deal breaker for me was that it does not fit snugly into a 12v socket.  The metal contacts are tight, but they are only two points of contact so the charger is free to wobble all over the place.  Most of my other 12v plugs have the two metal contacts and then two other plastic knubs to keep it in from moving around in the socket.

Returned it.",127,210
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Works great.  I got the dual so we could charge one than one phone at a time.  Real nice not have having to wait in line.,26,211
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This charger might be a little bulky for some people but it works like it should.  Nice to be able to charge 2 phones at once while traveling.,28,212
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,My husband and I usually fight over the car charger but this fixes the problem. Consider the placement of the ac adapter though because ours was at a weird angle and tight space so it was hard to have two plugged in at the same time.,46,213
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Had some problems with this on an old phone that would charge slower with this than a no-name $2 charger.  But after upgrading, my phone is happy with it, and it seems to be providing a good charge, while running efficiently and cool.

I'll give Motorola the benefit of the doubt, but be careful.",54,214
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I'm not sure what else I can say about it, it works with one exception...
It is a bit too small and doesn't seem to fit tight in the socket in my VW console. I have to monkey with it to get it to make contact properly. I will add this: it could simply be the design of the power socket in my car rather than this unit, I don't have any other brand to compare so take this with a grain of salt. I do know that my GPS plug fits in the socket and works fine.",98,215
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I have a Motorola phone so I can't promise all phones will work, but this wil charge my phone from any 12 volt plug in any of the vehicles I have. It is solid and comes with mini USB cord so you are ready to charge. I can recommend it.",50,216
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Good having 2 outputs. Makes it convenient. Seems like a solid build, unlike other chargers i had. Won't regret your purchase.",21,217
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Good quality, at a price that can't be beat. I really like the subtle white light that lets you know when it's plugged in and working.",26,218
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This little unit is excellent. Plugs in and provides ample power for charging my Droid. The extra USB port is a great bonus as it allows me to charge my Bluetooth headset at the same time. Great quality. Excellent product.,40,219
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This charger works great! I bought for my mom to use in her van. She uses it all the time!,20,220
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,Had a hard time finding one of our existing chargers to actually charge my Nokia 920 and iPhone 5. It charges all our portable electronics as needed.,27,221
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This is impressive for what it is.  Works well and is very well made.  I am ordering more to replace all of mine with this.,25,222
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,This car charger is just what I needed and works fine. Having an additional USB port makes it easier for me to charge my ipad when I'm on the run. I would definitely recommend this product.,36,223
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,what can I say? another quality product from motorola! it works well and has lasted a long time! I bought one for all our cars and they work great!,29,224
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is a great charger. I was looking for a car charger for my iPhone and this was one of the cheapest ones (if not the cheapest) that didn't have a terrible rating. It came with a Micro USB cable instead of an iPhone cable, but that didn't cost much so in the end this is a great charger.",59,225
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Just a heads up, I could not get this thing to work with my motorola atrix 4g.  It rapid charged fine for my GFs galaxy S, and my new Nexus 4.  But NOT THE ATRIX 4G.  Wish I would have known that; I swear I saw another review that said it did.  Tried in all three of my cars (honda, vw, ford), and no dice for the atrix 4g.  For that reason only, 4 stars; works great otherwise.",78,226
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"as another review has noted- has ""Output: 5V 750mA"" printed on it. It does not specify whether the 750mA is the total output or the output of each port.",29,227
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,I would recommend this to anyone.  So far so good.  It just seems so much better than the ones I have had in the past.,25,228
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"I received the product on time on the 17th and only just tried to use it yesterday, on Friday the 25th. As I had been so long without a car charger, I kept forgetting to try it out. I stress the word tried, because it did not work. I was truly upset, because I paid my hard earned money for a product that I expected to work and it did not. If you are going to tout a product, and charge a price for it, it seems only fair that it should work. I willl not buy from this seller again. I will not recommend this seller to another person. In addition to the product not working, the item received, differed from the photo shown. The description did say bulk packaging, but I thought that meant it would not be in the original box that one would expect.  Apparently it means, you will get the first thing someone lays their hands on. A disclaimer such as the USB cord may differ from the one shown in the photo would have sufficed.",181,229
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Pros:
 - works well

I don't have any complaints.",66,233
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is what you wan't if you need a car charger.
So Verizon started requiring all the manufacturers leave out the car charger on the docks they offer through big red. I can't explain how painfully and repulsive it is doing business with them. The only car charger Verizon offers is the one branded for them. They are so anti customer its ridiculousness.

The Motorola car charger is perfect though. it has high output to charge fast ( charging cable that comes with it can only be used with this charger, it will not work if you plug into your pc) the cable  so you can have an mp3 line cable into that and not have to run another line to your phone, just plug the phone into the dock and its already connected, big plus and not expected.
The charger also offers an auxiliary input for another phone to charge, girlfriend likes very much :)",156,234

Also the LED is not too bright so not distracting while driving at night.",51,237

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"The charger I received did not have the same model/serial number as the charger posted.  But it did have a hologram similar to the one in one of the pictures taken by another buyer.  It did not fit into my cigarette lighter well.  I pushed it in and it would pop back out.

The USB cord did not work with the enclosed car charger, and in fact, I  tried replacing the USB cord that came with my Razr M home charger with this USB data cable and no dice.  Didn't work.  The cable also didn't have the black/green ECOMOTO tag.  It came with a white paper tag with a picture of a flip top phone with an X over the phone image. There was no authenticity hologram on either USB plug.

I ordered this through AMAZON not a third party and am surprised at this ""bait/switch"".  It's going back and I will purchase a Verizon charger I saw here also through AMAZON.  Hope I have better luck with it as there are some people who are getting the ""bait/switch"" with that product also.",183,245

I don't have much to compare it with to see if it's faster. The two USB jacks are not right next to each other and that works well too.

Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This charger allows you to use your car to power or charge just about any electronic device through its use of a USB cable rather than a specific interface.  Because of this, you can use this charger to connect to two different devices directly with a USB port or any other power adapter port using a combo cable in the same way you can connect these devices to your computer.  For me, that makes this a convenient addition to my car and eliminates the need for carrying multiple different chargers.",90,263
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"Solid-built and seems to work well.  Its positive aspects are a higher charging current (850 mA), two charging ports, and using a strong and universal USB-to-micro-USB cord. The cord seems more solid than what comes with some other chargers.  But, at ~36 inches, it might be short for some applications.  I also think it's useful that the cord could be replaced if it becomes damaged.",65,264

But the separate data cable was not what i expected. At first, i thought they sent the wrong cable because the plug did not match my phone's (HTC Rezound) plug.  But after a gentle attempt it plugged in to the phone and the phone was charging. Because the plug is not exact and the cable is also very stiff, it is loose at the connection to the phone, purchasers should just be careful moving the phone or the wire while it is charging or they might damage the phone's charging port.",116,265

Now granted, neither port is the 2.1 mA that the Kindle Fire requires, but the micro USB data cable is the correct connection, and the Motorola charger works slowly, but perfectly.  My iPhone 4S is right at home on the other USB port, charging with reasonable speed.

For the family with multiple phones, this charger is the perfect solution. Most phones and small electronics have a USB-based charging cable that be added or substituted, at about two dollars each. I've got cables labeled iPhone, Kindle, LG8000.",122,275

It came well packaged in a Motorola box, and included a micro USB cable. The charger has successfully charged two Droid Incredibles, two Sansa mp3 players, and several other friends' IPhones.

The charge seems pretty fast, and the charger does not get hot (unlike so many others). No annoying lights are emitted to distract you while driving at night.

It does not, however, provide sufficient amperage for charging an iPad.  Granted it is not marketed specifically aimed at iPad, but as a dual, 'universal' USB charger, I wish it provided a bit more oomph.",57,280
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"There are other car chargers that can be purchased for cheaper, but the bonus of this one is the feature that allows 2 devices to charge at the same time. Also this is an official Motorola charger that is recommended for those devices as opposed to a generic charger.
Due to the fact that it does provide the option to charge 2 devices at once it is somewhat on the large size. However it is not so big that it hinders its use. It comes with a Micro USB cable along with the charger.
I used it to charge my phone and my Mp3 player (cable included fit my phone, I had the USB cable that fit my Mp3 player and simply plugged them both in). They both charged quickly during the car trip I was on.
Simply, this device works very well. If you are someone who has multiple devices that you would like to charge at the same time or need a Motorola specific charger then this device fills those needs perfectly.",174,281

Pricing is on the high side. You can find single chargers for much less. A dual USB charger like this is essential if you have only one outlet and it has to do double duty. If you have multiple electrical outlets available, then you're likely better off buying two separate off-brand chargers.",97,282
Cell_Phones_and_Accessories,B005LFXBLE,"This is a good charger for the car; it has dual ports, an unobtrusive power on light, and comes with a very nice cable for micro-usb devices.

Pro:
Dual ports means one can charge two devices (provided one has a cable for the second device - the charger only comes with one cable).

Attractive design, with sturdy construction. The ""Power On"" light is not overly bright, just right so as to be obvious but not blinding.

A nice, strong USB cable is included, which is long enough for car use (some devices only come with a few inches of length).

Con:
Not really a con, but the output is rated at 750mA, which means it will not charge any of the newer high power tablets like the Ipad or my Dell Streak 7 (both require 2000mA to charge). It will run my S7, but not charge it.

Summary: Nice choice if one needs the USB power for two devices. Highly recommended.",161,283

So whatever score/review the product gets, it's absolutely earned. At no time is a product given a particular review or rating simply because I fear loosing Vine status. That's not how the Vine program operates.

Anyhoo, onto the review:

Ok. Not much to say here, but I'll give a brief synopsis. This thing is built VERY well and even came in a Motorola box. The P617, with a higher amp output definitely makes a difference in charge time. I also have the Moto SPN5400A microUSB charger and not unexpectedly, the p617 appears to charge just as fast as the SPN5400A. Compared to my ""Sprint"" branded charger it charged my HP Touchpad in rough half the time on a trip to North Carolina. Also, as expected, when using both USB ports simultaneously, the current capacity is split between the two and charge time is less.

The well-built Motorola P617 works exactly as it should and it's excellent build quality should permit many years of charging.

Recommended.",193,284

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,these look like they'd work really well (good videos on YouTube explaining how to position them) but where I live the soil is extremely dry and very powdery - almost like flour - so it's difficult to get the thing positioned properly in the gopher hole since the tunnel just collapses as you try to dig down to place the trap.,61,6

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Seemed like a good product but I didn't catch the gopher with it.,13,10
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Before this Black hole trap I've been using Black Box trap which I like but when I miss the gopher the trap is filled with dirt. My theory is that the tunnel needs to be a little longer so the gopher thinks he has to push the dirt a little furthur. This trap is a little longer and does that. So far I have 4 kills in 5 trap sets. My guess on black box trap is about 60% success. When it gets filled with dirt you just have to keep following hole back and resetting trap. This has a flexible wire snare and black box is stiff. Easier to remove gopher from black box but this Black hole is probably a better design. I am buying more of these today,131,11
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,These are absolute KILLER for pocket gophers...  I caught  9 in two weeks.  For pocket gophers you need to make the hole in the end of the trap larger so it incites them into the trap better.,37,12
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Had very little success with this. Went back to the old spring traps and had a lot more luck. Too big and bulky to use without destroying your yard.,29,13

And no gophers.",56,14
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This thing doesn't fit into the hole and has to be propped up in the upper part of the gopher hole where they don't want to go.  Haven't caught a single one yet, needed to change back to the McCaffey (sp?) trap that fits down in their holes and traps them.",51,15

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I would actually give this trap a 4.0 rating but this is the only way I could send a note to all the 1.0 users. Alice Chop 1* got it right; the trigger mechanism is a main cause the trap fails to release the snare. For me it is always 1 of 2 reasons: 1) aluminum trigger pin is angled to put too much force/drag on/in  plastic trigger set hole and/or 2) there are traces of sand in trigger hole and/or aluminum pin causing trigger pin to jam instead of freely sliding free so releasing trap snare. Once you know this it is easy to test trigger release by lightly pushing on plastic trigger inside trap cylinder. Once convinced trigger pin is sliding freely leave set, position in tunnel, being confident if gopher enters trap to plug it will be caught.",141,18

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Trap is NOT sensitive. Adjusting the trigger to the most possible sensitive setting and I had to push the screwdriver with force to set it off. Instructions says slight bending may be necessary however that also does not work. It seems like a BAD design to have metal rod insert into plastic trigger which just does not slide well to set off the trap. The trigger should also be metal. The rodent does not have enough force to set off the trap. I may have gotten a defective unit but still don't like that the trigger is plastic.,98,24
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Caught the guy destroying my new lawn within a few hours. I simply dug out the fresh dirt to expose one of their holes, armed the trap and shoved it in.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Based on the reviews in Amazon, I bought this product. Unfortunately this product does not work for my gopher problem in my backyard. I read the instruction coming with the product and watched quite a few youtube clips on how to use this product before I set it up in the backyard.  I set up the Black Hole trap at newly dug mounds. Each time I followed the instruction,  but each time the gopher pushed the dirt into the trap which set it off. After about a dozen of tries, I finally gave up. Here are two possibilities that the trap does not work:
1. If the gopher has been exposed to traps before, it might develop a sharper sense of danger. It might pushed dirt into the trap instead of going inside to check the source of light. I live in a large residential area with backyard fences. The gopher might have experienced something similar in my neighbor's backyard.
2. According to some online readings and other reviews, gophers in Northern California tend to be smaller and are harder to be caught by Black Hole Gopher Trap.

When I saw the Black Hole, I knew I had to at least give it a try.  Placed it as close as I could tell into one of the more recent holes, covered it with dirt, leaving the ""light"" hole open and stomped on all the other holes hoping the little monster would take the easy way out.  I placed the trap in late afternoon.  Looked out the window the next morning to see that the spring was now in the unset position.  Could it be?  Had the demon seen the light and his little gopher brain told him to ""go towards the light""?  YES!!!  Success, one dead gopher!  I bagged and trashed that one and then locked and loaded the trap again, in case his demon spawn were still crawling around.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Bought this thing and caught a gopher within a day. No joke. Ive caught three with this so far. I do notice that sometimes the gopher will fill it with dirt... or at least what I suspect to be a gopher. It could also be a ground squirrel, as my cat caught one of those too. Long story short, it works... quickly.",62,30
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Save your money, this didn't do anything, the trap would never go off even after following the instructions to soften the curve on the latch.  Three times found it filled with dirt still loaded and kicked out of hole.",39,31
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Buy the black box. It's the only one that worked for me,12,32
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I had tried about 10 different methods. I ordered this last year. The first time I set it I got the mole! This year another mole showed up I set the trap and got it the first  time

Ray  Olympia Wa",41,33
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,The jury is still out.  We've been trying without success for just under 2 weeks.  Tried both moles and pocket gophers.  Tried without bait and with bait.  Tried with an open hole and with a covered hole.  Tried with dirt inside and without.  Tried it level and on a slant.  Most instances the result was a trap filled with dirt.  Sometimes it resulted in an empty trap but the tunnel sealed off.  The only reason I didn't give it one star is that it is easy to set.  Continuing with the assumption of a learning curve but not optimistic at this point.,102,34
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Bought this to use for squirrels who have decided to take up residence in my roof.  There is a little hole in the back I put peanut butter in and the squirrel chewed through the hole overnight to get to the peanut butter rather than go through the open/trap side.  Pesky little twerp!  So I covered the (now gigantic) hole with duct tape and placed the peanut butter on the trigger this time and voila!  Squirrel 1 - Me 1.  Game over!,82,35
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Yes bought this years ago before getting on the market and the only way I can catch gophers. Love It!,20,36
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"For a few weeks, I've been trying to catch a gopher that's been tearing up the yard and eating the plants. Using the smaller sweeney's style gopher traps ( https://www.amazon.com/Sweeneys-Gopher-Trap-Pack-S9013/dp/B000ZONYPE ), they were unsuccessful every time as somehow the gopher would just bypass the trap and fill the hole in.

I just got the black hole in the mail today, set it it up within 10 minutes and 8 hours later I heard it go off. No more gopher!

This thing works 100%. Set it up and then wait for the gopher to come investigating.",95,37
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,This trap works great.  I trapped 2 gophers in 2 days with this trap.,14,38
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"1 dead mole ,  reusable, reliable. I also have some small metal ones that moles are tripping but not getting caught in because the dirt from hole gets between them and the trap, this cylinder design prevents that and is working. The sonic repellent things are crap and worthless.",49,39
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Thingamabob would not catch without alteration, hard to set, too easy to accidentally release while you are covering it up. Not worth returning it.",24,40
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Just trapped my first mole last night!!! These traps are easy to set, and they definitely work! Be patient, and buy these traps!!!",23,41
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Don't hesitate to buy this trap' it works! Caught my gopher within 2 hours!,14,42
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Once I got the hang of using these I have trapped several gophers. A trick that worked for me is to fill bottom of trap with soil so that no plastic is evident on floor of trap. The wire noose should be hidden inside trap and behind front lip of trap. I leave the small hole in the back of the trap open. If you trap a gopher, dispose of that gopher, then reset the trap and put it back into same tunnel system. You will likely catch another gopher in another day or two without having to dig more. These also seem safer to have around pets than other traps. My only complaint is these are larger than other traps so require digging out a bigger hole to seat them properly against gopher tunnel. However I decided not to take off any stars for the traps being large since these traps do the job well.",156,43
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This guy helped me with chipmunks. Those little folks couldn't be trapped with anything else, I've tried more humane approaches, but ended up with this as a last resort. First, I put food inside w/o having it charged to let them get used to it, then I got them all snapped within next few days. Sorry to see it worked out this way, don't like killing animals at all, but I can't see what they've done to my lawn...",79,44
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I have tried many traps. Nothing compares to this one. Easy to set, easy to unload, and it works amazing!",20,45
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Still have gophers.  Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because maybe my gophers are really smart and don't want to enter.,21,46
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I have been trying to catch a gopher for 6 months - no luck -.do not buy - old school spring traps much better,24,47
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I have had two traps set for 3 months now, and have had zero gopher bodies to dispose of.  I've been using in Cottonwood, AZ, my second home which I visit every few weeks as an absentee homeowner.  My gopher problem has actually gotten worse, since I've not been using smokers in these areas, in order to give the traps time to work.  But I'm still trying them, silly me!",70,48
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,so far am loving it was kinda scared to catch one but i caught 2 out of the same hole now lent it to my brother in law to try but now i have some more starting i live by a park it beats paying the mole man and it works my cousin has caught over300 of them yes thats right but she lives on 20 acres shes the one who told me to buy the black hole one,79,49
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"So far my nemesis gopher has only filled the entrance with dirt.  the trigger for this trap has so much resistance i am not confident that a gopher will be able to push it hard enough to go off.  ive baited with carrots, potatoes and fresh greens and he still isn't interested.  ive tried everything. losing this battle :-(",59,50
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I don't write too many reviews, but if you are anything like I was then I hope this helps. I live in a court, the gophers have been bouncing back ruining all 4 of our yards for over a year . We tried flushing them out, to no avail. One neighbor went with the electronic noise stakes, another with poison pellets. Neither did anything. The last straw broke when I was walking across my lawn to check a sprinkle and a huge portion sunk in under my feet. I live in CA and it's hard to have a nice yard while being water restricted. There was no way I was losing my yard to this gopher! I searched online high and low, reading every review until I found this Black Hole Gopher Trap. Don't take my word! Look at the pics people attached. They truly work. I would definitely recommend buying 2 and putting them back to back. My Amazon package was here Wednesday,  gopher caught Thursday. Thank you for your product!!! Will proudly recommend to everyone with pest problems.",180,51
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This is an EXCELLENT product. We had a major gopher problem and, prior to purchasing this, we tried gopher poison. We had very little success with poison but, with this trap, we have caught several gophers.
MINOR DOWNSIDE - It is pretty unpleasant to get the dead gopher out of the trap. Wish they had constructed it such that I could release the gopher without having to touch it (gross even with gloves on!!)",74,52
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I purchased two of these products, and they both performed poorly for their intend use. I found them difficult to activate with a stick, and moderate to heavy force. None of the traps have activated, even after being physically moved out of place by the animal. The trigger, even when balanced on the edge of activation, is too difficult to trip.",61,53
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Didn't catch any gophers, but works great for catching rats. Best if you tie it down to a heavy base and block access to the rear hole.",27,54
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I bought two traps, caught 1 pocket gopher somehow, but since then the gophers keep burying the trap.  I used the black boxes before but I buried those and lost track of where I buried them, I think I'll order two more of the other ones.  I'm not sure, but I think the opening might not be big enough for my gophers so they just pack the trap with dirt instead.  But hey, at least I caught 1 gopher.",79,55
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Used as directed and it caught a gopher within 15 minutes.,11,56
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This gopher trap was super easy to set and worked perfectly.  The day I received it I opened it, found a fresh mound of dirt and exposed the gopher tunnel and set the trap.  I put a little of the dirt inside the trap so it seemed like part of the hole.  Out of curiosity I checked the trap about 30 minutes later and it had already sprung with the gopher caught!  30 mins!!!  If you have a gopher problem this trap is about as easy as it gets to solve your problem.",93,57
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Works great. 4 moles in 2 days. You gotta have a couple of these.,14,58
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I'm catching gophers left and right now.  If you get it at the right angle and cover up the end hle...BAM...you will get yours, too!",25,59
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Works great.. I have gophers doing destructive things. I was recommended this trap, and it's worked great. I'm following the instructions and so far it's worked each time quickly. As soon as I see loose dirt, I find the hole with a shovel, set the trap and within 30 minutes the pest is removed..   So far clean kills as well, I just depress spring and cable and rodent falls out. Was a little worried about blood and guts as the cable and spring are strong, the gophers I'm getting are coming out clean and completely dead.",96,60
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Wow!  The first was in just 4 hours.  Everytime has worked like magic.,13,61
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"When I asked my husband on a scale of 1 to 5...how many stars would he give this....he said ""seven"". He's used it twice and caught a gopher each time.",30,62
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Got this trap at the local hardware store and their version is called Gonzo but it looks exactly the same. Set the trap in the afternoon and noticed it had already caught a gopher within 6 hours.,37,63
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Works great. Go two the first day. I put some dirt on the bottom. Had to dig the hole bigger so it would fit.,24,64
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I had something digging tunnels in the yard. I tried many different things to get rid of it. This finally did the trick and caught the gopher that was ruining my yard.,32,65
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,They are great I have used them in the past and they still work great. Easiest way to get rid of them,22,66
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Fantastic! Gopher caught that same day! Everyone needs one of these who has gopher problems.,15,67
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I have caught about 5 gophers with this trap using peanut butter.  Can't say much else, it works!  However, you have to bury this at the entrance of a gopher hole by digging down to ensure the trap is in line with their tract system.  It takes a bit of effort but the payoff of a saved yard is well worth it!",62,68
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Ok I was not sure about this trap but my nephew who works at a golf course said these were the best for killing moles and gophers. Took me two days and some moving around of the trap but bingo got his butt!,43,69
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"One gopher in first 24 hours. Waiting too see if I have any more gophers. Easy to set. Nothing can move out of place to disable trap after it is set. Dig your hole, place trap, cover with dirt. The spring kicks up right though the dirt. I also baited with small piece of carrot.",55,70
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"The wife gets great results.  When she forgets to check them before dark, the scavengers take off with them because half the body is usually stuck inside.  Needs a cable and stake or screw auger",35,71
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This bad boy works like a champ. I did have to add a wire and ground stake to it because if you forget to check that trap that next day, some unknown animal takes the trap and gopher to devour it at a different unknown location.",46,72
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Awesome trap!  I have recurring issues with gophers and moles as my home backs up to open space.  I used it on my hillside where it has been difficult to successfully place other traps. This one worked first time, eliminating a very large gopher that was causing a lot of damage and eluding other traps. Contrary to the reviewer who said that it did not deliver a quick kill, mine dispatched the rodent cleanly and quickly the first time. I love this trap and couldn't ask for a better performance. This was money well spent!",95,73
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Works for me almost every time. Find a good lateral burrow, set the trap in place (one facing each direction) and pow. If I get a good set, I nail them.",31,74
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,needed a few more of these as the gophers are taking over this year - not so much any more!  Black Holes are the best traps we have found - quite reliable and easy set up / clean up.,39,75
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"1st day in hand.  found gopher canal, set trap placed in hole.  Added some moss around trap plus some dirt to close in sides around trap.  Next day pocket gopher DOA.  Tried poison.  Did not work.  I highly recommend this trap.",41,76
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I tried bait and ultrasonic generators with no luck. I picked up the trap at a local hardware store and when I saw an open tunnel I dug up the end and planted it. The trap was easy to set and place.,42,77
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"the best invention ever. caught 5 of them after wasting $ hundreds on stupid chemicals and smokes from home depot and lowes. that is a complete waste of time, this things works like it should . highly recommended",38,78
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,These are the only traps that really work for us,10,79
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"100% best gopher trap I've had ! Owned it two days and caught two gophers I've been after with standard traps for week and just got buried . Takes zero time at all expose tunnel/ place /seal light around it with dirt . Check in an hour and  done with these pain in the ass pest ! Buy it ! Set it ! Ask questions later ! Been trapping gophers in AZ for 3 years and by far the easiest , most effective trap I've used !",87,80
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I purchased the black hole gopher trap and have successfully eliminated 8 gophers from my garden and heard area.  Poisons did not work for some reason.  These traps are easy to set and easy to release the dead gopher.  Without touching the dead animal.,44,81
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Takes some work to set properly but I am hopeful.,10,82
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I tried several times with bait and without bait. The voles that I have just dig around it. Other traps that I have worked much better. I recommend not to buy.,31,83
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"It looked like it should work but it didn't. I tried every orientation, but it only got packed full of dirt and pushed out of the hole.",27,84
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I will begin by saying that we live on 9 acres that used to be a hayfield. Every summer/fall the gophers and miles start to go crazy in our yard. Despite the fact that we use an old fashioned trap, it wasn't enough to catch the little buggers. My husband was complaining that he needed another trap so he could set both sides of the tunnel. I read reviews and ultimately decided on this one. It arrived and we were convinced we would catch one right away! Nope. He set it twice. The darn thing set the trap off but it didn't trap it. Finally on day 3 we caught it. In a months time, we have now caught 12. My husband has perfected his gopher catching skills and I couldn't be any prouder ;)",135,85
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Did not work for me.  I followed instructions and it did not work,13,86
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"30 gophers down. When will the war be over? Trap is still 100% functional, highly recommend for a humane way to remove pests. (More humane that poisoning or explosives)",29,87
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Best gopher trap ever. Bought others but nothing worked until this one.,12,88
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Probably ineffective if used alone as a gopher deterrent strategy.,10,89
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,the moles just when around or under it,8,90
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Great product!!!
I bought one 20 years ago and it's a fantastic gopher trap.  Still using made old one, but want another one because it was sooo hard to locate a new one.
It is very effective!",37,91
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Got a gopher in 15 minutes! Worked great!,8,92
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I've caught a few pocket gophers with these traps, but they are overly large. You have to put a large hold in the ground! Normally, you have to put two traps in the ground, one facing each direction, because you don't know which direction the little bugger is coming from. That gets to be very pricey with these traps! I've gone back to the Victor style traps exclusively.",68,93
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Works very well, we have gotten many many gophers with this trap. If I have any concerned it's that the piece of metal at the top can bend a little too much and has to be re-aligned, but that's not too much of a hassle considering how you have to set the thing. Would recommend.",55,94
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"The traps work great if you have the knowledge on how to use them. I went my first week getting skunked. I was putting them in old gopher holes, not fresh ones. I tried 2 new gopher holes and have been 2 for 2! Downside is gophers are ugly as hell and I had to look at em.

Update:
A few weeks later and I've eradicated all the gophers in my lawn.",72,95
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Only product that works for me. We have a huge gopher problem but whenever I see a new mound, I go grab this. Just make sure that you really dig out the hole, enlarge the tunnel and try to get this to lay as flat as possible. Whenever I've been lazy and didn't want to take the time to really dig it out properly and flat, I haven't caught them. Yes, you have to dig out your grass a bit more but the gopher will cause much more damage in the long run.",93,96
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Trap did not work. I checked it twice after leaving it under the ground for weeks at a time. Good news is is that I have not seen any gopher holes in quite a long time. Trap is easy to set up.,42,97
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Best gopher trap on the market. Easy to set in works much more efficiently than the regular steel gopher traps partially because the Gopher is halfway into the Trap before he realizes that he's in one. Thinking that the whole on the other side is the end of his tunnel. I have had Gophers who have avoided the steel traps 4 days get caught in this one within a day. Would definitely recommend,73,98
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I've tried others but this one worked the best.  Probably trapped a dozen so far.,15,99
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I challenge the designer to try to set this trap by following the instructions.,14,100
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Took some learning time  to make it work. Had to set it as sensitive and used peanut butter.,18,101
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I've tried many ways to kill the pesky and destructive pocket gophers. This thing is perfectly designed and I was able to wipe out the population in my lawn and garden. 7 dead pocket gophers so far this year. Be sure to buy two so you can trap both sides of a tunnel at once and not guess which side they will come from.,64,102
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"After trying every means to get rid of gophers without killing them I had to step up to something like this. This little box is the only thing that has worked for me. After dealing with gophers for the last 5 months I was able to trap 2 gophers in 48 hours you cant beat that. Just find a new spot where dirt is pushed up fresh, dig a small hole in the tunnel, I used a little dab of peanut butter inside the trap, set it, cover with loose dirt, and check periodically throughout the day. One gopher did get trapped and not killed so I did have to kill it myself. Do yourself a favor and save your landscape and money by just starting with one of these if you have a gopher problem.",136,103
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I have used several different types of gopher traps.  This trap has  a 99 percent success rate for gophers. This is the trap to buy if you want to keep it simple. Thank you,34,104
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I have a gopher issue in my neighborhood, when they started digging into my basement crawlspace I knew I had to deal with it.  My dachsunds dig up their holes, even sometimes the runs, so I can put a pair of traps in exactly the right place.  The only issue with this trap that I have had is that it has never had a successful kill.  The gophers have dug around it and filled it with dirt; something about the shape seems to make them suspicious.  I have another trap that is square shaped and it has killed 2 gophers and one squirrel.  I feel sorry for the squirrel, he must have just been curious.  The trap caught his foot with the upper arm, then when I let the dachsunds out they killed him.  The dachsunds also killed one gopher on their own, Caught him right at an exit hole where he must have been caught unaware.  So the trap itself is fine, seems to be in working order, I just have not had the success others have had with this style of trap.",184,105
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I have a lot of experience trapping gophers on a small farm. I've given this trap a couple months and have yet to get a single gopher in it while my standard Sweeney traps catch dozens. Not recommend,38,106
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Trap works well, but sometimes the moles outsmart us.",9,107
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"So far the gopher has outsmarted this devise,  Not sure if the trigger is too tight, really set the trigger as light as I could and the critter still won out.  Resorted to poison bait in front of the trap and he filled the trap most likely after eating the bait.  The bait worked.... the trap....... well it's in the bucket waiting to see if I can get it to work on another one.  I have used these in the past with some success, but after setting this trap a half a dozen times with only getting it filled up with dirt by the gopher he is either very smart (thinking 'caddyshack' here) or this trap isn't working very well.",120,108
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Every year we get a few gophers tearing up our garden/yard.  This trap takes care of them.  The tricky thing about this trap is the placement.  Place it wrong, and the gopher will backfill it with dirt.  You have to make the trap an extension of the gopher's tunnel.  It can be tricky doing this near plants  or sidewalks, it's better to find a hole away from those things.  Get the trap in the right angle, and you'll catch your gopher.",81,109
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I got one of these after the gopher tripped my cinch trap twice, but didn't get caught.  With this trap, I dug out the hole a little bit and placed the trap at an angle so the air hole was facing up.  I covered the top of the trap with loose dirt and waited.  A couple hours later, the gopher was caught dead in the trap.  This trap is easier and so far, better than the cinch traps I was using.  Highly recommended.",83,110
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,This takes out gophers amazingly well .. we use two of them on our ranch.  Highly recommend.,17,111
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Two catches in first three sets. One failure was on me as I assumed incorrectly the direction of travel of the gopher. Will recommend to others.,26,112
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Do not buy this trap. I can not set. The hole in the black holder is not big enough. There are much better traps.,24,113
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Works quickly and effectively.  Trap can be used at the end of a run or inserted into the middle of a run.  Cut a clean edge to the gopher run and butt the trap up to it.  Seal any gaps and cover the trap with loose dirt, leaving the air hole open at the end as well and not impeding the trigger mechanism.

I work some dirt all over the trap when they are new and put some loose dirt in the trap too when putting it in place.  Bait it with a few slivers of carrot peel up the run a foot or so, and then more in the back of the trap,  Gophers have a keen sense of smell.

It's a little difficult to extract the wire from gopher, but worth the effort on this very effective trap.",140,114
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This is the first gopher trap/bait that I've tried over the years that consistently works. I'm three for three this spring and it's easy to set compared to other traps. The trick is to probe with a thin stick or wire to find the tunnel, then dig it out, insert the trap on a 45 degree angle and use the loose dirt to cover any sunlight, except for the hole at the top of the trap. Best to set as soon as you see a new mound but I caught a gopher in an older mound, four days after I set it!",102,115
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,The black hole gopher trap is the one that I have had most sucess with to trap pocket gophers or moles as they are called in our area. It is simple to use and very effective.,36,116
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Total piece of crapola,  pretty much all plastic, worked once never worked again.  I recommend getting one made out of all metal.",22,117
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This thing is easier to use than it seems.  I didn't think it would work and I was skeptical on how to utilize and implement it. However, guess what it did work!",32,118
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"If you have gophers you need this trap.  My dad has over an acre of land and the gophers were running ramped.  We tried all sorts of things that we heard about from firecrackers to smoking, but nothing seemed to work.  I came along this trap and figured, what could it hurt?  So it turns out this trap is AMAZING!!  I got my dad two different shaped traps. one round, this one, and one square.  I didn't care for the square trap, even though it worked, it was awkward because of the square shape.  This trap, which is round, was much easier to work with and best of all IT WORKS!!!  Once I put the trap out, within a couple hours I had a gopher.  This works like a charm!  I had to purchase more so I could place multiples around the yard and not have to keep using one.  It truly is a great trap!!",156,119
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Too large for the gopher holes in Northern California.  Instructions also require putting dirt into the trap hole.,18,120

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"A gopher was tearing up the front yard. I ordered this black hole and followed a you tube video of how to set it up. The next morning I saw it was sprung and pulled out the trap. I caught the gopher, so success there! Then I had to do the gruesome deed of finishing off the animal. It wasn't dead.

Next, I tried the trap several times trying to catch the gopher in my garden. The garden gopher must be a little clever since the trap was sprung on two different occasions but no gopher inside.

So for me this product is a mixed bag, success and the agony of defeat!",112,122
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,For older people this is hard to use.  It also requires some real experience to make it work right and position it properly. The main problem is that I expected something that would at least work a little differently as I am concerned at how well it works.,48,123
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I love these things.  I have probably caught hundreds of gophers in the past 10 years using these gopher traps.  It is a simple and effective design.

We used a wire trap from Home Depot to no avail.
When I read the reviews for this product I was really skeptical but it was worth a try. Well it didn't take three minutes but more like three days but we finally caught the little sucker!!
This trap is big and we had to find the most recent tunnel and make the hole bigger. It was half in and half out of the hole but we covered it with some dirt and put a milk crate over the top to keep our dog and cat away. This product worked when nothing else did !!",162,135

He has pushed dirt into it causing it not to go off. He's crafty. I am less than pleased - I spent more money on a "" lawn ornament"". I have used other methods and traps which have worked in the past with the exception of this guy.
Does the company have any ideas? I've even baited it with dandelion roots and other succulent roots which have worked on other gophers.

I thought I had a mole problem, but started thinking it was gophers. The standard scissor trap was not working, so I opted to buy the black hole trap. Within 12 hours I caught my first pocket gopher - the trap is excellent is works for both gophers and moles.

Overall I have bought about 15 of these traps and loved them. But, the latest ones have caught zero gophers and my neighbors have the same problem.

Ran outside 10-15 minutes later and a gopher was caught and killed quickly. No wiggle wiggle like I've experienced with mice and mice traps. Easy clean up. No blood, guts or gore.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I caught 6 gophers in a row in one week.  I am surprised that my backyard has so many gophers.  I cut open the back so the whole trap looks like a big pipe to expose the light better. I dig the gopher hole to make it big enough to cover the front of the trap.  Then I inserted few baby carrots in the trigger divider. So far this is better than any other traps I have used.,78,166

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Works great.  My first one broke after many years and many dead gophers.  I found that if a gopher is packing dirt into the trap, that you either need to dig deeper into the tunnel, or I put a strawberry into the ""peek hole"" at the end of the trap.  Cover the trap lightly with dirt then cover the trap with a garbage can lid to keep light out.  Also try and set the trap so it is level and not angled up.  I don't know how many gophers I trapped with this thing but like I said, it worked so good that this is my second trap.  I have a pet so I can't use poison.  Using this trap you can see the dead gophers when you catch them.  To get rid of the gopher, push the trap wire back down, shake it out of the trap and bury it back in the hole as a warning to the other gophers not to come by anymore!  You don't have to touch the dead gopher.  (sometimes it does get a little stuck, though)",183,168

When the gophers start digging air pocket holes, you have to dig them out and find the main tunnel, placing this trap in the main tunnel, guessing which way you believe the gopher is at, in about a day if  you have placed it right the trap will get them.  I also bait the traps in the end with the left over poison that I have found ineffective in killing them, but it does attract them to the trap!  I have gained new confidence in being able to maintain a garden without it getting destroyed thanks to this trap!

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Pocket gophers make it almost impossible to garden here on the western mts. next to Nation Forest. If one is not eternally vigilant one may as well not bother planting anything, that includes edibles, perennials and trees. With over 35yrs into this fight, I have tried any trap that might do the job. The Black Hole for some reason outperforms, the common wood box type and the Black Box (which is the molded plastic version of the wooden box. In-tunnel pinch-types are too wide for the tunnels here.
The Black Hole seems to work better than the others because: it does not light-leak, the end hole is larger (what the gopher perceives as the end of the tunnel), the trigger is located differently, is shaped differently and can be set to be very sensitive requiring less pressure to activate, the round interior loosely mimics the gopher tunnel, the round shape is easier to locate snuggly at the tunnel entrance and lastly, there are no big hardware holes that allow cover dirt to fall in and alert the gopher.
These are all best guesses based on observation, but it clearly outperforms the other types",193,199
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"We were over run with pocket gophers last year, but after using these traps consistently, we don't have a gopher problem anymore!  Take a little time to learn how to use them correctly and you will trap the gopher every time.  Whenever I see a fresh mound, I find the tunnel, excavate it a little to fit the trap tightly to the opening of the tunnel, tuck in a little dirt around the edges so the hole in the end of the trap is the only light the gopher sees, and within hours I've trapped the little bugger.  No more damage to crops, irrigation ditches, etc.  I highly recommend this trap over those that fit in the tunnel or have an open bottom.  I've tried all three and I find this one works much better and is easier and safer to use.  Just don't put your fingers inside while you are setting the trap.  When you catch the metal hook into the hole in the plastic trip piece, try to set it as ""lightly"" as possible, only catching a little of the plastic in the hook so it will be like a hair trigger.

#2) There is a bait hole in the back.  Tape over the hole in the back. Use clear tape so that the critter sees light at the other end. Pour bait in from the front. Otherwise the Squirrels will attack the bait from the rear and trigger the trap.

I engaged in a full scale diplomatic mission to convince the gopher to move elsewhere. I also tried non-violent water boarding methods to no avail. I chose a method of removal commensurate with the Geneva convention articles on the subject. The deceased was painlessly sent on to its future life.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"At the same time I used these traps I also used  several Victor ""The Black Box Gopher Trap 0625"".  The Black Box traps caught about 20 pocket gophers.  The black hole traps would just get buried.  It seems the hole was too small for pocket gophers so I tried it on ground moles but it didn't work for them either.  The ""Cinch"" traps worked on several occasions also where I had problems with the Black box.",76,209
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"As noted by others here, this trap does work but the spring-and-wire-loop system is not strong enough to kill all gophers outright, sometimes leaving the final ""coup de grace"" to you. The Victor ""Black Box"" gopher trap has worked consistently well for me.",43,210
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,it did not work for us. we try in different spots and we have not catch any mole at all,20,211
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I recommend to  ones who have problem with gopher to buy one of this. very useful device for catching gopher.,20,212
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This seems to be a fairly well-made trap.
We still haven't caught our gopher-enemy with it, but the design is clearly better than the standard galvanized metal pincers.",28,213
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This trap is fantastic. Followed directions, and in the 9 times I've set it, I've caught 7 gophers. Some within the first 20 minutes of setting the trap. Easy to use, very effective.",33,214
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This trap came highly recommended as the best way to trap moles.  We bought 4 and set them up all over the yard.  It has been months, haven't caught a single one.  We decided to have someone else find and set the traps for us thinking we were doing it incorrectly, but no luck.  Maybe it isn't the trap and we just have really clever moles.",66,215
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I have one. My neighbor has a Victor The Black Box Gopher Trap 0625. She loaned me hers. I'll compare both models.

Snap on the Victor The Black Box Gopher Trap 0625 is more forceful and seems to kill the gopher more quickly
Gophers seem to prefer walking on the ground, not through this tube
Easier to set the Victor The Black Box Gopher Trap 0625 as it can sit on the ground level. With this model you have to hollow out the dirt  to insure it doesn't roll.

This is nice but the Victor The Black Box Gopher Trap 0625 is better. I recently bought two Victor The Black Box Gopher Traps and prefer them.",116,216
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"After spending hundreds of dollars on poisons, gases, deterrents etc. I finally have found the solution to my gopher problem. These traps are fantastic and I caught both of my gophers within 36 hours.",34,217
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"worked real good on the first gopher but after catching that first gopher, the trap has not caught any. They push soil into the trap.",25,218
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Great, great trap.  Once upon a time I use to walk across my yard and almost break my ankle because of gopher holes.  Now after using two traps I have taken out a total of 40 gophers.  Once I set the trap, I usually get the gopher overnight.  If not, I then move the trap to another location.  Once you get the hang of setting these traps you will be very pleased with the results.  I recommended this trap to a neighbor down the block and he might pass me soon with a total of 36 captured!",97,219
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,works great! I have already caught two gophers.  Just leave in the hole over night and by the morning the gopher was caught.,23,220
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I followed the instructions to catch some ground squirrels but had no luck with this trap.
Even after setting it for many days and use of recommended baits the chippy is too smart to get caught.",36,221
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Quickly caught some critter who then walked off with the trap connected to the critter somehow.  Had it down in the opening of a ground squirrel hole.,27,222
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I had used this trap 15 or so years ago and could not find it when I moved back to the country.  I tried some others in the meantime and could not handle the gore of the most effective one.  I was delighted to see this on Amazon.  I had caught two gophers within 5 hours of receiving the trap.  I can empty it almost pretending I'm not working with a dead rodent.  A local red tailed hawk looks for my catch every day as I put it in the meadow next door and keep the food chain moving....,99,223
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Easy to set up, works great. If first setting results in it plugged with dirt, clean it out, reset, cover the hole with cardboard to keep out the light, and you'll be rewarded with a deceased pest.",37,224
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I have owned three of these traps and they are just straight gopher killers. I attached a little flag to the tripwire to let me know when they are set off. It usually is within an hour after being set that a gopher has being dispatched. Since I have owned these two traps(about a week)  they have killed 7 gophers with modest effort and about a 85% effective kill ratio to false trips. The gophers have to close the open hole to prevent predators from getting to them and that is how the trap is so effective is because they are put into a catch 22. They will die if they leave it open and they will die if they fill it. It goes to the base instinct of the gopher to it's own demise. Great product. I have owned one for over 8 years and still killing!,148,225
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I placed the trap in the ground and within one hour I had one nice big gopher trapped.  It didn't kill it instantly but it still works great.,28,226
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I read all the reviews before buying but when the trap arrived I doubted it would work because the gophers are bigger than this trap.  The gophers pack it full of dirt and go on about their business .  Disappointed.  Because nothing seems to work that I have tried.,49,227
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"After trying juicy fruit (I was skeptical but desperate), smoke sticks, etc.,  a friend showed me this.  I set it late one evening, then woke up to find a gopher the next morning.  So I set it that evening, too.  Before dusk, I already caught another one!  Set again, strike again!  After 3 days of use, I've eliminated 5 gophers and counting.  These things are amazing!  They are definitely worth the money.",72,228
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"This is a good product, but not recommended for sandy soil. The gophers simply push sand in to the trap, tripping it. I have caught gophers with it but not in the sandy parts.",34,229
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I tried two other gopher traps but the springs were so hard to set I had to return them.  Then a friend told me about the Black Hole and how easy it was to set so I ordered two.  He was absolutely correct.  Even I could set them.  Within 30 days I caught 20 gophers!,55,230
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Very carefully followed all the instructions, even did some research on gophers so I understood them and how to locate their main tunnels which is where you want to set the trap, not their air hole tunnels.  Absolutely a bust.  Tried several places, even baited with garlic although that supposedly was not necessary.

Save your money, don't buy this thing.",60,231
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I didn't trap a gopher, but they left anyway.  It must have scared them away.  Maybe they won't come back.",20,232

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"worked well for us, not so well for the pocket gopher.. lots of bitching by his family.  recommend it, yes",20,234
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I have caught 6 gophers with the small steel trap, but I have had no luck with this black hole. maybe I'm not using it correctly, but if that's the case why do I catch them with the other traps? It's the same concept, just put it in the hole.",50,235
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I had a black hole several years ago but it went missing--think I loaned it to a neighbor.  This one has too much plastic which can break.  It's not as sturdy as the old one.  It catches the gophers very well and it's easy for me to use.,48,236
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Several times I put bait in it and several times the trap was tripped but nothing was in it.  It just sits empty now.  I will be returning it.,29,237

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I have used the Black Hole gopher traps for the past 20 years and had to purchase a new trap recently because I misplaced the previous trap.  The Black Hole  works!!!  I caught 5 gophers in 6 days!!!!  I read recently to place a carrot soaked in olive oil in the hole at the rear of the trap.  Don't laugh.  It worked!!!,62,246
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"We bought 2 of these after trying several other "" cinch traps"" to no avail.  The moles are ruining the yard and are digging tunnels all over.  After reading the reviews and being frustrated, we set these up ""end to end"" to get them coming in from both sides.  After one night, both traps were still open, not activated, but the varmints had covered both of them with dirt.  This is exactly what had happened when we set the cinch traps as well...placing them deep into the holes, covered with black plastic and a bucket to keep all light out.  Traps sitting there, not activated but buried in soil.  We even tried the poison peanuts, but seems like they are dining and dashing.  WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG?  Have lost our sense of humor as well as money.",138,247
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"The trap requires some hand strength so be extremely careful. Other than that is is easy to set and works just as it says. I call this and the second trap we bought ""the decapitators"". It's kind of sick but when you can't get to these guys.

Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"I purchased two of the Black Hole traps and they work very well. The only issue I have with them is
The spring tension is lacking in strength. When the trap is triggered and it captures the goffer it doesn't apply
Enough pressure to kill them instantly and they sit in the trap and fight to get out of it until they either die of suffocation or I finish them off myself. I hate to see any animal suffer and for that reason I switched to the Black Box traps. They are similar in the way they work like the Black Hole. Except their spring rate is a lot stronger and do the job instantly. I personally would recommend the Black Box over the Black hole.

Thanks for reading.",129,256
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Does not function animals do not trip trap. Product cheaply made trap trip settings to stiff to trip when animal enters trap.,22,257
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,I've tried various gopher traps and have limited success with each of them.  I tried these hoping for increased results.  The bad thing about these is the diameter of the size hole needed to put them in.  I think if they reduced the diameter size by 30% they would be more effective. I've often found that I can't get them in the tunnels because the trap is so big.  My success with these is about the same as other traps I've been using over the years.,86,258
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,yes these traps work and yes I've caught several gophers. The problem is the quality. I purchased these 8 to 12 weeks ago and the springs have now punched out the back. 1 trap is no longer useable. ***disappointing****,39,259
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,Wow! I ordered this trap and when it arrived I had a fresh gopher opening. Set it according to the instructions and less than 3 minutes later I heard it snap and had my gopher. I know it was lucky but less than 3 minutes is amazing. Nicely built trap so I am sure I will use it many times.,60,260
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"Hi there,
Read the great reviews, bought the trap, didn't catch the gopher. We've tried everything and the furry little creature still evades us as he eats his way through our yard. We've moved the trap to fresh 'mounds' morning and night, we've tried moistening the soil around the mound hole to simulate rain (this is supposed to get the gopher to come up to ground level), my hubby is really good at anything he does and even he is stumped. It's definitely a gopher, not a mole, because the cheeky little devil popped up to have a look at us! We don't know what we are doing wrong, we've followed all of the instruction, but the trap is not catching him. Would not buy this product again.",128,261
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,It's not the best.  I've caught two gophers in two weeks.  I have to admit that it's the only trap of three that I purchased that caught any gophers.,29,262
Patio_Lawn_and_Garden,B000P9F1JQ,"The Black Hole Gopher Trap is the best underground critter trap I have used.  It is easy to place in the ground and quite effective at capturing the varmits.  I have many Voles and they have been difficult to trap with other devices.  The Black Hole misses about 1 out of 8 and that is only because they sometimes push enough dirt ahead to trigger the trap before the victim is inside. I have tried the wire spring traps, poison smoke, car exhaust via a hose adapter and none are as effective as the Black Hole.",96,263

Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"While impressive aesthetically, the graphics on the engine are not printed straight. What's really frustrating for my 3-yo boy is that magnetic couplers are very weak compared to wooden Thomas, TRU Imaginarium resulting in train breaking up. After few days I eventually removed these engines from his train table.

2013 Update -

Toys_and_Games,B003AH6MJS,"We love Melissa & Doug products, but I was very disappointed in this one.  The train looks great, and is very sturdy, but it's just too long, and even a bit too wide to fit our tracks (mostly by Maxim, with a few Melissa & Doug pieces). I really wanted to keep this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter, but testing showed it would just be too frustrating.  Your mileage may vary, but the length of each engine means they definitely can't handle the short curved pieces, and the wheel width even made it rub on many of the (Maxim) straight pieces.  I also got her this other similarly sized M&D engine:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freight-Train/dp/B003AHE0XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freight Train</a>, and works just fine.",121,2

Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,Pics don't do justice. I love the colors in these dice and my first roll on the d20 was 20 lol. Licky dice,23,26
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,Christmas gift for my son and he loved them.,9,27
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Beautiful set of dices that show a more metal side. Case did crack on opening, but it was small and not noticeable",22,28
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"First d&d set! Arrived quickly! Beautiful set! Some favor the gray/steel, but most are a beautiful blend!",17,29
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,Gorgeous!  Thank you.  Fast and exactally what I needed.,9,30
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Came on time, look sweet, you'll be rolling 20s in no time",12,31
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,Beautiful set of dice.  Looks like molten metals melted together.,10,32
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"These came as described and good quality. The swirling is absolutely beautiful! I bought these to go with my boyfriend's ""metal"" set for when he plays his dwarven bard (I know, it's a strange combination but it's fun and hilarious). They were the perfect addition. I actually think these might be his favorite.",53,33
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Very nice set. They look and feel great. As far as I can tell, there are no defects.",18,34
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"These are superior quality, just like all of Chessex's dice. These look really neat. Some of my fellow D&D players are jealous of them. I have the purple-steel w/white also. They are great.",33,35
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Daughter said daddy open your present its dice! Gotta love kids, he doesn't know what kind yet but I know he will be happy with it.",26,36
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Sharp, clean edges with a nice weight.  The numbers are extremely easy to read.

If there is a downside, it's that I'm DM'ing and I'm killing my players with all high rolls and natural 20's.",35,37
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"My go to set! It's gorgeous, very easily read, and rolls very nicely. The set I had received has more steel than copper. The edges are sharper than some of my other sets (rounded edges).

Very similar to the feel and weight of the Chessex's Scarab Royal Blue with Gold Numbers. This is my second favorite set.",57,38
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"The dice seem to be molded from good plastic, and the colors are pleasing, the numbers distinct enough to be easily made out.",23,39
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"If you are a gamer, you need dice. And once you get your first set you start to wonder, ""Do I need more dice?"" Yes..... yes you do.",28,40
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"These dice are very brilliant looking, just as pictured. However they tend to roll low numbers a lot and got my priest into very bad situations. I had to place them in time-out and use other dice for awhile. Beware!",40,41
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"my friend wanted these so much when he saw my set that he wouldn't rest until i told him where to get them.  they were still an option, even after ten years or so since i bought mine.  very gratifying.",40,42
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"I love the look of these dice. Despite the color splits (the focus of the Gemini name) , The colors themselves look great and, when they do mix, mix well. The thing is though, my set roll really low. When I was rolling these for fun, I consistently rolled ones. at least 3 in a row, when it would suddenly roll an 18 or 20. It may just be my roll though...",72,43
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,Excellent iteam for playing DND with the steampunk look is great when playing the steampunk version would definitely but again.,20,44
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Very tight - thanks for the alignment!  AND your system of ratings.  There could not be a better way of saying it, according to the Dutch anyways.",27,45
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Love the coloring in the dice set! Plus, go great with the dice bag I decorated myself. Got these for my youngest, because she likes to play with her dad's set, which makes it hard to play DND. She was very excited to receive these!",45,46
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Started playing roles games with the kids, they ordered this set for their role playing, everyone is pleased as expected.",20,47
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"I do like the dice in the picture, but I didn't fall in love with them when i saw them in person. There was a lot more of the copper coloring than the steel so it made them look weird, but they are still awesome dice. They are a great collection to any gamer/dice collector. They are a really great price and they arrived on time and all, not any issues. Even though the coloring isn't my favorite, its still a great set.",83,48
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"You can never really tell what you'll really think about dice from pictures... sometimes they look great in pictures, but not as good in person... and vice versa.

I bought these to give them a try and for a different color -- since I needed a lot of different kinds of dice for a new game I'm playing -- and while I thought they looked okay in their pictures, I can't describe how much I love them in person.

It's kind of funny... I always used to laugh at my gamer friends who have ""favorite"" dice and love them so much that they won't even let you touch them... but now I understand!! I get so excited to roll these babies...

Copper-Steel... who would have thought? LOL.",127,49
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Fun to use and great quality. Picking a set of dice is all about the looks and I like these a lot, one of my favorites.",26,50
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"For the price, they are certainly worth it. I think they are gorgeous, though depending on the individual dice, the swirl can make the numbers hard to read from across the table. (Please note that I am also as blind as a bat.) I've been playing with them for a few months now, and the white numbering is starting to wear off a little bit. There is an indent where the number is should if it gets bad enough, I could go in with some acrylic paint to fix it. Overall, I would recommend this set.",96,51
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"I don't know if I'm unlucky or something but these dice are pretty bad. The picture shown isn't exactly accurate as the ones I got had more gray than anything. Not even silver, it's gray. I would have been fine with that if the copper had a presence, but it doesn't. Besides the d4, the rest of the dice have little to no copper on it. My friends thought the copper on the d20 were little ketchup stains. The percent die looked like it was supposed to have more copper because it had lines that hinted at a swirl pattern but the entire thing is gray. Overall, these dice aren't what I thought they were, but then again, maybe I was one of the unlucky ones that got the dice that barely made it through the coloring process or something",140,52
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,He like it. It is good dices... feel light but great. It is too hard to gift wrapping it though.,20,53
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"They are a decent set of dice. rolls are pretty random.

only knocked it down a star because my set had all the dice 70-80% silver. all of them barely had any orange on them.",35,54
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,The copper and steel look on these dice have a real steampunk feel to them. The ones I got have plenty of variety in the patterns. The D8 has about 90% steel with bits of copper swirled in. The rest are a half n half mixture.,46,55
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,Can't say much about how precisely random they are but they're not obviously biased and they are gorgeous. I've gotten compliments on them.,23,56
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"These dice are sexy. They looked just like the image picture. I got them as a gift for one of my new players that just got started playing D&D and Pathfinder. Still I almost regret not getting them for myself, they look really nice.",44,57
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"I love these dice! They're gorgeous. Sadly, the D6 from this set turned out to be entirely the steel gray with no copper swirling, but I know that the coloration is random and that isn't really the fault of the product. The gray doesn't really have the same luster as the copper so the poor little D6 is terribly boring looking. All the other dice are gorgeously marbled.",68,58
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Ah, dice. Can't play your favorite tabletop RPG without them. This set is very nice looking but much like other dicesets it doesn't bring anything new. It's a nice looking diceset at the same price as others. Numbers are easy to read and it is extremely well balanced. I will say though I have only rolled one or two crits with these so these dice are good but I fear they might be bad luck for me. Take that as you will.",82,59
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,these look great in person. very bright colors easy to read numbers. I like that the edges are not as rounded as others. now if my DM would just stop rolling constant 20's.,33,60
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Bought this for my kids who started playing D&D often enough with me they needed their own set, dice has a nice solid feel, strikes well and at least for my kids rolled high numbers more often it seemed :)",40,61
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,I really like this dice set.  It's exactly as pictured and also comes in a plastic dice box.  The only small detail I would change is the white on the dice is chipped.  it's barely noticable but when I buy something new it would be nice to chip the paint myself. I would buy these again. They work perfectly for my Magic The Gathering playing.,65,62
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,I got this set because orange is my favorite color and they are beatiful! They are like the picture and have sharpe edges too. This is also my first set of dice. They are wonderful!,35,63
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"I rolled natural 20's every time with these...

... But really the dice are great nice blend of colors, and the numbers are big enough to quickly and accurately read the dice.",32,64
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"The colors were (and still are) bright and true to the photo here. They have a nice shine to them as well. These dice feel very nice in hand. I have bought several sets of these, in different colors, and they all have held up very well.",47,65
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,I ordered a few set of dice for a friend at Christmas and I was temped to keep these for myself even though I have no personal use for them. The pictures really don't do them justice and they really look like metal. I would recommend them for sure!,49,66
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"my only complaint is that the edges aren't ""sharp"", but they are still recognizable.  That being said, I've seen much sharper edged dice.",23,67
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Inexpensive, not to use the word cheap, but I didn't spend a lot on these and they are worth about what I paid.
Functional, but if you want something better you will have to pay more which is how it should work.",42,68
Toys_and_Games,B000UU8M1Y,"Got 10 sets of these in varying color combinations for my ""Wednesday night gaming group"" as Christmas presents. Everyone loved them!",21,69
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Gets a 5 star... very cute police dress up costume. great quality. and fun accessories. Thank you very much for a great product.,23,0
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Cute.  Came very quickly and everything there.  My son enjoyed being a police officer.  He was loving it for Halloween.,20,1
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,This was a Cute costume for my 10 yr old. Fit great. Belt is very cheap but otherwise very nice.,20,2
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"I bought this for Halloween for my 6 year old. There were a few slight issues...He broke the handciffs within 3 days (but of course they are plastic ones), The belt it comes with is kinda cheesy...it doesn't stay tight and it about 3 feet long. I trimmed it and stitched it up in a few places to make it work a little better. Also, the costume was a little big for him. I had to do a lot of taking in on both the shirt and the pants. But, with a little work we got it to fit good and it was a cute Halloween costume. He wears it every now and then for dress up and throws me in jail!!",122,3
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"I was pleased that the pants and shirt are made of a thick, durable material...something that can definitely stand up to a 7 year old boy!  My son loves the costume and has worn it numerous times before halloween already. We've even had to wash it and it came out looking great (delicates cycle and line-dried).",56,4
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"The costume it's self is cute and will be played with for awhile.  The ""duty belt"" is a one day use and the handcuffs are to be looked at and not used.  Of course the handcuffs are what kids want to play with and is this items biggest let down.",50,5
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. He absolutely loved it! The handcuffs were broken within 5 minutes, but its still worth the price compared to other costumes that I looked at.",35,6
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Very large for my four year old who wears 4t pants.  The pants are very very long.,17,7
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Purchased as a birthday gift for my little guy.  HE LOVES IT!  It looks authentic, doesn't wrinkle when tossed in the dress up box, and is better quality than your average costume.  The pants are a little long, but nothing that can't be easily hemmed.  So far we've just rolled them up.  He is a growing boy after all.",59,8
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Bought an XSmall and the pants are as tall as my sons entire body luckily it's a play costume but we cut off about 12 inches and still need to have them hemmed,33,9
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,We got this as a gift for one of our nephews. He loved it! His smile on his face. It engulfs him as a 4 year old but he will grow in to it and be able to have it for the next few years. Seems well made. Note the provided cuffs are plastic and super cheap looking. I doubt those will last but the outfit is sure to be fun for a good long while.,76,10
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,My son is 7 yr old and and is a husky boy. This costume was perfect. Love the material well made. I ordered Large because he is a little chunky. He is 4'9 and weighs around 95lbs. The size was perfect for him. I would definitely recommend it.,48,11
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Good quality costume.  Fit my husky 6 year old (pants were a bit long).  worked great for ""furture career day"" at school.",22,12
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Great costume.  Seemed to run a bit small.  I'd order a larger size than the child needs.,17,13
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,This product was perfect for my 8-year old nephew who wants to be a cop . The accessories work nicely (no sticking on the handcuffs) and the outfit is made of nice quality material.,34,14
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"The costume has included with it a short, pants, belt, handcuff and badge.  The belt was essentially useless as it was very large (I cut it down to size) and doesn't really have a latch or clasp of some type to keep it held in place.  We pinned it to his pants because he wanted the look.  Over all, the fabric seems to have held up well.  After Halloween we washed it in tha machine (though the label says to hand wash) and it has held up to the occasional dress up day.",93,15
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"The pants were larger than the shirt, but it all fit well enough that our great grandson could wear it.",20,16
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"I love the band.  It looks great, attached to my fit bit just fine.  The size i ordered was just a bit big for my wrist,  so i don't wear it as often as I'd like.  Would order another like this in a smaller size next time.",47,17
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"It did the job. My son wore it for a school parade (1 hour) and trick-or-treating for about 2 hours. He is a tall 6 year old and the pants were about 4 inches to long...easy to hem though. Mediocre quality, but fine for the price and for just halloween use.",51,18
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,I love this costume.  So cute and fit well.  The hat is a bit flimsy.,15,19
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"I liked the costume. My kids loved it. The pants were quite a bit longer than I had expected and I went by his typical pant size but it was still too long. The shirt fit well though. Although the larger size, 10-12, fit perfectly on my 9 yr old who wears a size 10 in jeans. So I guess it's just iffy on whether it'll actually fit true to size or not.

Very thin material, which is typical of any costume. The handcuffs are your typical cheap plastic cuffs that easily break. I did, however, buy a separate badge that looked more authentic that hangs around the neck but the one it comes with works fine for what it's purpose is. The hat, however, although I thought was cute never ended up getting worn. Very flimsy hat just mainly material with no shape or form to it. Both of my boys hated the hat but the costume is still cute without it.",163,20
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My son loved this.  The badge kept falling off, so I glued some Velcro on it.  The belt needed to be paper clipped to stay on.  Spot clean only, I think the lettering may wash off.  Hand cuffs are plastic, bought a different pair to go with the uniform.  Sun glasses NOT included! ",53,21
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Fit perfectly! Good quality for a Halloween costume,8,22
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,The costume fit just right and the material is of good quality.,12,23
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"The product description said this was a cotton costume. The product I received was 100% polyester, yuk!",17,24
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Cute costume but it runs big and the toy accessories are cheap and fragile.  My son was disappointed that the billy club wasn't included.  I guess I missed that in the product description,33,25
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"This is fantastic! I bought this last year for a Christmas present for my son (6) and oh my word, my son loves it!! He wears it all the time, and brings it with him to dress up when he visits his grandma, and he loves pretending to be a police officer.",52,26
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Got this for a friend for her nephew. It fits perfectly. The quality is good.,15,27
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My grandson whom I purchased this costume for absolutely loves the outfit, the handcuffs however broke almost immediately as they are cheap plastic. Fortunately he had a better pair before he got the costume, Uncle purchased a nice pair of handcuffs to go with the outfit (and extra keys).",49,28
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Fun costume, made for great material.  Prefect for child's play",10,29
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Super cute costume. Pants were a bit big, but didn't look bad once the outfit was all put together. Just a little weird in sizing when comparing the pants to the shirt, but my son was able to wear thermal pants comfortably under them to stay warm for trick-or-treating Halloween night.",51,30
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,A little big but otherwise perfect. Timely delivery and just as described.,12,31
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My daughter enjoyed wearing this costume for Halloween but I do feel that the accessories could have been better quality. The outfit is a two piece and my daughter is a short petite 7 year old. The pants were way too long so I had to cuff them inside the leg and then pin it so it wouldn't drag. The shirt was fine, but the elastic part on the chest pocket was too weak to hold the police badge. The belt for the waist was terrible. It was fraying before we even left the house for Halloween. Also it was so long, we had to overlap it for more than half her waist for the extra piece.",117,32
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Yes my son absolutely loved this costume, pants were a little big but did the job",16,33
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Great costume. Size medium was way too long for my 7 year old, but we taped it up with fabric tape and it was fine.",25,34
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,This costume is great! It's nice and light for comfortable play without being flimsy. The hat and accessories were a hit with my grandson.,24,35
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,The fit was good and the material and workmanship was what I expected for a costume.,16,36
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My 5-year-old loved the costume. I had to hem and take in the pants a lot, but the shirt and the hat fit fine. She's 44 inches tall and 36 pounds. Great quality, I imagine this would last for many hand-me-downs or dress-up days.",44,37
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,The costume and delivery was exactly what we expected. No problems what so ever!,14,38
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"This costume was cheaply made but it was ok for one night.  The belt was very flimsy and would not support the handcuffs as they are shown.  Also, the police ""badge"" kept falling off of the shirt for some reason and we ended up losing it on the street.  My son was not happy about that.  The hat is also very misshapen.  However, my son did enjoy wearing the costume and that's all that really matters.",76,39
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"The costume did not include badge, belt & handcuffs. PANTS are very long however shirt is nice fit.",18,40
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Costume fit my 10 year old son perfectly. He is 80 pounds and 58"" tall. It is the cheapo Halloween costume fabric, and the accessories are chintzy but to a kid, it doesnt matter- it looks real, therefore it is cool! He is happy so I am too.",48,41
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Best ever!  He's even slept in it he loves it so much!  Belt useless and no stick fyi,18,42
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Nice fabric.  Did not see the costume on but it was good quality.,13,43
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Pants are ridiculously big/long.  Must hem them... But it's absolutely adorable and looks like it will hold up reasonably well.  Badge will not stay on shirt but overall great purchase.,30,44
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,My grandsons love to play dress up in this Police uniform. The fit was true to size and well made.,20,45
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My 10 year old daughter asked for a police uniform for Christmas. We ordered her this costume with another set of handcuffs (reviews said handcuffs were not great & they were correct, as they broke within hours). I have washed the uniform and it has held up. She is on the smaller size, we ordered her the size recommended for a typical 10 year old and it was just a little big for her. Based on this, I would say it runs true to size. It is a nice costume for the price-but order sturdier handcuffs to go with it!",100,46
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"I thought this was a very good quality costume and I would recommend this to others. The pants were a little big for my 5 1/2 yr old son, but it just gives him room to grow in.",38,47
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Lots of fun for my son. He loved the outfit for Halloween and after school playing cops and robbers.,19,48
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,It's a good costume but it runs big. My 6yr old is swimming in the pants.,16,49
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,Our grandson loved this uniform and wears it often. Good quality for the money.,14,50
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"The sizes run smaller here.  Barely fit my 9 year old and I ordered 10-12.  Quality was as expected, nothing fancy.",21,51
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,It was a great custom my son enjoyed it!! Fit him really well the pants were a little big but gave him room to put pants under neath to stay warm! Do with the hat had a lot more structure to it. But over all it was a great costume!!! Give it 4 stars.,54,52
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My son liked it. My only complaint was the hat was kinda cheap feeling so I bought a nicer one at party city and it worked. Other than that, happy with purchase.",32,53
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,It looked great on me! It also came with everything said! I Loved this costume because it was good quality and if you Loose the handcuff keys there is a thing you push. I T is worth the money with free shipping. this costume is worth it! ,47,54
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,The material is thin which is suitable for our weather (summer all year round). He is slightly shorter than 120cm and the pants are too long. Some alteration will do the trick. I thought the baton will be included but it wasnt. He still loves the costume and cant stop wearing it.,52,55
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"Cute base costume. We ended up getting a different belt and badge than the one that came with the costume to make the costume ""cooler.""",25,56
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,We got just what we expected in a timely manner,10,57
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,I had to dress my son up as a community helper for school. This was a great little costume for this day.,22,58
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"This costume was made of very nice quality fabric.  I did have to hem the pants for my five year old but he adored wearing it.  The handcuffs were pretty cheap and easily broke and the badge didn't want to stay on when he was wearing it.  Other than that, we were very happy. :)",55,59
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"It's a pretty good costume; the quality (as with most costumes) is not great, but it got us through Halloween!  I bought the small and it was a little big for my 6 year old boy; definitely room to grow!

Overall, I would recommend it; just know that it's cheap and don't expect fine craftsmanship!  :-)",56,60
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My son was thrilled when this arrived and wanted to wear it immediately!  It ess for Halloween, but I did let him wear it a few times before the big day.  He thought it was great an had a blast with it, but I was very disappointed. Everything about this costume was cheaply made. The belt frayed and was not wearable after one use. The little handcuffs broke while ""handcuffing"" the first bad guy (big bro) and the hat was just a piece of fabric, no structure.  Thankfully at a young 6, my son didn't care. Next time I'll look for better quality.",103,61
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"The costume was very realistic and my son loved it.  As others said, the belt is of poor quality.  Overall, a decent value!",23,62
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"This costume was cute and convincing on a small middle schooler for our play.  The belt and handcuffs were cheaply made and not usable, and we replaced the hat with a sturdier theatrical prop, but the costume itself was nicely made and washable.",43,63
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,My friends kid loved this costume. we also bought him handcuffs separately and a gun as well. he loves it a lot !,23,64
Toys_and_Games,B001CCSNZO,"My son was desperate to get this costume, and the waiting was worth it.  The material is a little bit on the cheap side but for the price, I think can not complaint.",33,65
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"While I know that Halloween costumes are typically cheaply made and over-priced for what you are getting, this is truly gives meaning to the word ""crap."" The thing, slinky material is see-through - you can't go trick-pr-treating in that without a few layers!  Also, the ""i"" emblem on the front was messed up and looked like it hadn't been allowed sufficient time to dry before the item was packaged. To make it worse, returns are a complete pain.  You have to email the merchant for a return authorization number or it will be refused at the door, and you only have until a certain date to return it.  I will NEVER, EVER order rom this merchant again. Take heed to my warning no matter how much your little Peanut loves the Incredibles.  Order from another merchant at the very least.",140,0
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"Our little boy wanted an incredible suit for Halloween. He was only 2 1/2 years old so I was worried the suit would be too big, but it fit great. He loved the suit, and several months later he is still occasionally wearing it. The suit is well made and has yet to show any signs of wear.",58,1
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,thin but easy to wear clothing under it,8,2
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"This was a good material for the price, fit good but may size a little small. Delivery on time.",19,3
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,Expected somewhat better quality for the price. Super thin and screen print emblem. Not worth $25 but I guess worth your kid dressing up in the character they really wanted. What's a mom to do?!,35,4
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,My son wears size 3T and this fits him fairly well.  He's been wearing it all evening and running around but it's staying on good.  The mask fits his smaller face well.  We'll have to roll up the sleeves and legs a bit but it'll work fine for playing superhero or for Halloween.,53,5
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,OBVIOUSLY THE MATERIAL WONT BE THE BEST OF THE BEST BUT IT DOES ITS JOB AND MY 3 YEAR OLD IS ABSOLUTLEY IN LOVE WITH IT AND THATS WHAT COUNTS.. GOOD PRICE COMPARED TO HALLOWEEN STORES WHERE YOU PAY 30 BUCKS FOR THE SAME MATERIAL!,45,6
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"OMG! My grandson looks soooooo cute in this outfit! It's a little big, he's only 2 1/2 so he can wear it for a while.",25,7
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,Perfect for my 3 year old son! Held up well for multiple Halloween parties.,14,8
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,our son Dash loves dressing up in it,8,9
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,My 2 and a half year old loved it he wouldn't take it off,14,10
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"Couldn't believe how fast the product arrived at my door.
I placed the order on Friday morning and it arrived by Sunday. Unreal.
The costume is great. Great price. Great costume. Can't beat it.",34,11
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"My 3 year old son (who wears 4t clothes) fit this outfit perfectly! And it's super adorable to me because I got the matching Mrs. Incredible outfit. So both of our costumes together are the cutest!
But my little man fit this perfectly! Not too short, not too roomy, he can still wear a long sleeve shirt and a pair of long john pants on under to keep warm because its going to be cold outside, and the costume will still fit perfectly! He loves it! And so do I!",90,12
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,Great costume for my son was delivered fast,8,13
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,Fits my three year old perfectly!! He loves it!!,9,14
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,Son wanted to be Dash so this fit the bill. My son is small so this fit but IMO I think it runs small. Mask is way small (useless) & it is cheap but will do for one night.,39,15
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"Oh boy!  all 3 Grandsons, loved, loved, loved them!!!!  Made very well, good packaging. Was a big hit!",18,16
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,My 2 year old loves it.  He's 29 pounds and almost three feet tall and it fits him perfect.  The only issue is the mask.  It barely fits his head and is really tight on his face.,37,17
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,I like it so much! But I would suggest it will be made with 100% cotton. My son is allergic to polyester and although he loves to wear his costume it is not possible to let him to use it for long time because his skin starts to rash. Cotton would be more fresh and easy to wear for kids. Overall the costume is awesome!,65,18
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,The costume looks exactly like the advertised picture except for the boots are not included. My son is absolutely excited to wear this.,23,19
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"Great value, made well, good colors but the straps on the mask is not made very well so it was too tight.  I had to make new straps but overall my son loved the costume.",35,20
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,Great costume for my 3 yr old. It held up well at Disney World for the Mickey's not so scary Halloween party!,22,21
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,The costume worked perfect for my son. It looks just like the photo (minus the black shoes). We just put black socks/shoes on him,24,22
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"Mask can easily tear, costume fits great. True to size. Need to but black shoes separately. My boy loves it.",20,23
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"It's a simple costume. The mask did not fit my child and in fact the elastic snapped while trying to fit it. I'll have to buy a separate mask. My son loves it, so I guess that's all that matters, but I think the price is too high for the thinness and cheap make.",54,24
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"Size and description were exactly right.  My son can't wait to wear it for Halloween.  It was a great price, too!",21,25
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,My son wore this for multiple birthday parties and it even washed well. He loves it. Fits more like a solid 3T. Would start to get snug on a 4T.,30,26
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"My obsessive Dash-son loved it. Wore it for days and days before Halloween. The mask was iffy...never really fit to where he could see out of it, but the clear sides on it (which make the mask ""float"" on their face like the ones in the movie) were really cool, and in general, it was great.
Downside...it won't last much longer, as it's just worn down pretty quickly. We still have some use left, but it's not going to make it a full year.

Pros: fun and true to the movie
Cons: Cheaply made...but hey...for the price!",97,27
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,We bought this for our son to wear for Halloween.  Material is very thin and tore during the hour it was worn.  Not what I would consider a quality item.,30,28
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"Nice cute costume, but the fabric seems very fragile especially if it got stuck onto finger nails, there's be a pull in the threads.
Nonetheless, it's cuteness makes up for it.",31,29
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,Excellent costume! Got it as a gift for my niece's 3rd birthday and she was thrilled! Made her day! Thanks!,20,30
Toys_and_Games,B0009IYR3O,"It's not made better or worse than most other kids costumes. Your child will be a lot warmer with clothes on underneath it, but it still looks good on alone. And it's easy to take on and off. We also like the fact that the mask is not so tight that it hurts his head. He's been wearing it all day long and it hasn't left a mark!
overall, this costume was worth the money for us.",77,31
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,I bought this for the 'Homework Help' Center at my local library.  The librarians were thrilled with it and we know it will be useful for the upcoming school year when the elementary kids are studying fractions.,37,0
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,I am amazed at the amount of learning they facilitate.  My students love to use these tiles.  It really helps them to be able to see the fractions and compare and make equivalent fractions.,34,1
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"These are great for explaining the fraction concepts to children. My kids got it right away, and every time we need to come back to them, they're there, more clear than any explaining I can do! Love these.",38,2
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"It works well teaching fractions, just wish it would be easier to store without all the pieces falling out.",19,3
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"This is a good tool for teaching fractions.  The pieces are somewhat small, though, and easy to misplace.  I'd recommend working on a table with this one.",27,4
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"This product was exactly as described.  It loses one star from me because one row of tiles is slightly too big and it buckles just a bit in the tray.  And also because it doesn't have a cover, making it really hard to store unless you keep it in the box with is about 3/4"" deep.  I have limited storage in my home, and storing something so flat in something 3-4 times it size is aggravating.",76,5
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"My daughter was thrilled with it.
It is the same one she uses at school!",15,6
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,I use it in my 4th grade special ed class... they love it!,13,7
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Bought this item for my seven year old. We used it as a game, and she really enjoyed it. She has not started fractions yet in school however I know from her grasp of using the tiles that this tool will help her no end.",45,8
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,These are a wonderful tool that truly help my third grader visualize fractions when trying to figure out greater and lesser fractions.,22,9
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,He learned so fast from this. Things clicked in his head made fractions so easy!,15,10
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,My 3 year old is extremely interested in numbers. This has been a great tool to take numbers to the next level. Now he is always showing me halves and wholes  they have stickers and stuff to show more details of what the fractions mean in other ways. I would get this again for sure.,55,11
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Some of the rows of pieces don't fit in perfectly, but my son seems to enjoy playing with them anyway.",20,12
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,One of my favorite teaching tools in 5th grade.,9,13
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,I want to like this more. As a concept it is great for teaching fractions. But what I would really love is for it to be magnetic and/or have a locking lid to keep all the pieces contained. It comes with additional stickers you can use that use other fractions like pie charts and decimals. Again it is a good resource but I wish they put a little bit more effort into it to make it a more solid resource and not so easy to lose or misplace pieces or awkward to store.,93,14
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"This would be ten times cooler if it was wood.  but it's still a super cool learning ""toy"". We homeschool so it'll be used with most of our meals and baking and whatever else we can get creative with!",39,15
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Made fractions for my daughter so much easier, especially with her propensity towards spatial learning.",15,16
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Great price for this product! And my kids just love playing with it, can't wait to start doing fractions using this tool! A must have!",25,17
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"As described; useful tool for us as we homeschool.
not too flimsy either",13,18
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"My daughter was using this product in her class for learning fractions. She was having a harder time at home without it, so I ordered her one to use here. She loved the ease of it and this product sure did make fraction homework a lot quicker!",47,19
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,These tiles are perfect for our homeschool classroom.,8,20
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Kids like playing with it.  Would be improved if it included percentages or decimals on the flip side of the tiles.,21,21
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Bought it for a 10 year old who found it interesting and has quickly discovered relations between various fractions. It's summer vacation so I didn't expect her to pay much attention to it now, but she has taken it off the shelf several times to just play with it.  I am sure it will come in handy when school starts.

Interestingly, my 3.5 yo is also playing with it, calling it a 'puzzle'.

Some of the blocks do not fit in a certain order but then fit perfectly after rearranging.",90,22
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Extremely useful for visualizing fractions -- bought it for my second grader, but also found it helped me :)",19,23
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Good product for my 3rd and 4th graders,8,24
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Anything from Learning Resources is well worth purchasing.  I am a tutor and my students love their manipulatives.,18,25
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,My 9 year old likes working with it and he said it's very helpful. Came on time and even had extras that I wasn't expecting.  Pie chart and anther fraction chart!!  Bought one for a friend.,36,26
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Got this for my son to use to help with his math homework. They use these in school. It really helped him understand his fractions better. It was also a great tool for him to use with his tutor.,39,27
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Excellent resource for homeschooling, but I think my kiddos like playing more with the colored tiles flipped over! Great for visual and tactile learners",24,28
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"One of my children struggled with fractions - this was an invaluable tool.  I cannot recommend it enough.  Now, with my younger children - it is the only way we teach the topic.  They learn their coursework and then practice with these.  If your child struggles - it makes it easier to explain to them.  Excellent tool!",57,29
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,This is my favorite tool for teaching fractions.,8,30
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I bought this for my third grader to teach him fractions. He loves using them, and they have been a great help.",22,31
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"These are a great visual for my child learning fractions.  BUT they only have the evens 1/6, 1/8 etc, so they can't be used on problems with an odd denominator.  Also, the tray is nice if you are laying it flat, but what am I supposed to do when it gets tilted to the side and the all fall out.  ugh.",61,32
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"This is a great fraction resource. I love how you can really visually illustrate fractions in a way that even a kindergartner can understand. My favorite part is that the pieces line up, so, for instance, if you're trying to show how it takes 2 1/4's to make a 1/2, you can easily see how they add up. Then you can show how 4 1/8's make 1/4, and the 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 all add up. It really is great for kids' to understand fractions in this way.
I would buy this product over and over again. The only thing that is a downside is, as others have mentioned, that the tiles are hard to keep in place. It wouldn't be hard to put a lip on either side of the product holder and have a plastic sleeve that could slide in the lip and hold everything in place. I use about 5 well-places rubberbands to hold everything in place once we have it put together. Still, I love this product and haven't seen any other ""fractions help"" that is nearly as great as this one.",186,33
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Just wish it was a little larger for my kindergartners.,10,34
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"The tiles did not fit in the board, bad cut. My son wants sucession why they chose to skip numbers is hard for little minds. Nit worth the money.",29,35
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"My grandson's tutor loves this product, is helping him learn fractions faster",12,36
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,This is a must to have in every home with elementary and middle school children,15,37
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,This is a gift for granddaughter. My daughter in law requested it as a teaching tool.,16,38
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Very innovative and easy way to learn fractions.  My family math teacher loved it.,14,39
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"This is more versatile than it looks...great for teaching equivalents & inequalities, etc.  Size and color are just right.  Great teaching tool!  I'm working with a second grader, and she really grasped various fraction concepts quickly using these.",38,40
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"These tiles are great for teaching children fractions. Easy to use, and not easy to destroy.",16,41
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Difficult to storage, need to be handle gently. Not like what I expected.",13,42
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Great learning tool for today's children. I wish it would have come with some sort of container (better than the packaging) as the pieces tend to fall out easily. A great deal of these learning tools are on the upper scale of price in regards to the materials used. The construction of this is very basic and nothing extraordinary.,59,43
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Nice set, but I should've gotten the magnetic ones.  Easy fix is to buy the magnetic sheets (arts & crafts store, office supply, or Amazon!) and stick them on, then use a magnetic white board.",35,44
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"It's easy for an adult to know 1/2 cup is less than 1 cup, and we can tell our kids that and have them memorize it, but to take it one step further and show them how each fraction differs from another is better. These are great for youngins as well as older children who are identifying, comparing, adding, subtracting and even multiplying and dividing them!",66,45
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I am able to learn, as well as my grandkids. Fractions are easy to understand when you can see it firsthand. The numbers are bold and easy to see.",29,46
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Plastic tray. Little plastic tiles. Expensive for what you get, but helpful for visualizing fractions and talking and learning about them. I would add a star if there were a clear plastic cover to hold the tiles in place for easier storage.",42,47
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I got this for my mathematically inclined 4 year old.  He was interested in cutting things into halves and thirds.  He enjoys playing with this and mixing up the different fractions to see which ones add up to 1.  This makes the concept fantastically concrete.  I prefer this to other young child fraction toys because it not only let's you easily compare the fraction to a whole, but also easily allows comparison between fractions.",74,48
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"My children LOVE the fraction tiles - I can't tell you how many times they have taken the tray apart and put it back together just for the joy of it. We are enjoying equivalent fractions, adding, subtracting, and looking forward to many more things!",45,49
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Very entertaining and helpful for kids math.  Realy loved the fraction strips. Very helpful for homework in math.
Helped me so much in math.  Cheap too.",26,50
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,this is a wonderful tool to teach small kids about fractions. it makes since for them to see it this way. if you are home schooling this is a must. good buy and easy to understand. my 5 year olds are understanding this concept way before other kids.,48,51
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I got this for my daughter who is a tactile learner (3rd grade).  Each plastic chip is a sturdy 1/8"" thick.  She enjoys dumping them out and putting them back together in various measurements.  Fractions can be particularly confusing since the denominator is larger than the numerator, yet here it is easy to see that 1/3 is larger than 1/4.  This is a terrific addition to your ensemble of fractions tools if you like manipulatives.

The reason for the minus star is because I can only store this flat or all the tiles fall out.",95,52
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Good tool and manipulative for teaching fractions; particularly 1-to-1 settings but would have preferred the white board being magnetic in function.  Easy to loose pieces once the package is open.,30,53
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Great product....I would love a class set. Fast delivery and the product is roughly close to A4 size. Looks like its picture and very easy to use.,27,54
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Have bought this for my 5 year old to teach her about fractions, this is a great tool and I highly recommend it!",23,55
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I rarely write a review, but after seeing how well both my kids (5 and 7) learned their fractions from this ""toy""? I went searching for the review box. Both kids enjoy just putting the tiles into the right place for fun. Even this simple task helps them to see how the fractions fit together. We can do so many things with this and it is so easy for them to SEE how the fractions go together. How the fractions add up and how 2/4 is so obviously also 1/2 etc. I am truly amazed at how well this has worked for them. I highly recommend and am very thankful to have found this math tool. This is one of those very few things I will pack away and save for THEIR kids to have someday.",136,56
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Great visual for helping children learn and ""see"" the difference in fractions.  The bright colors are great, and children love manipulating the fraction pieces!  Great educational tool!",27,57
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,This is a visual aide that is easy to understand and handle.  The moment we began using them there was an instant understanding of what I had tried to teach before.,31,58
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,This is a fun way to show fractions and explain how they work. I found it to be quite effective.,20,59
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"My first grader is supposed to start working on fractions in school this year, so I ordered this to help her when she gets there. She already really likes moving the tiles around and I think it will help her have a feel for fractions even before she officially learns them.  The tiles feel good in the hand and the colors are bright and appealing.",65,60
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"This is an excellent, well-made material for teaching fractions. Shows the relationships between fractions very clearly. Love this for home or school use.",23,61
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Our third grader is currently learning fractions and this manipulative is a huge help.  We also have the decimals and percentages for our older child.  We use these trays daily.,30,62
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,I've used this tools to introduce factions to my 4 and 6 year old. It has worked well. I've read that it's better to use bars vs. the traditional pie pieces.,31,63
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"These fraction tiles are one of the best things I bought this year. They are thick and sturdy, and make a wonderful hands on addition to math class.",28,64
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"We got this for out son when he was 5 and he really liked (and most importantly understood the concept of) this toy. What a great way to introduce fractions. He loves stacking smaller fractions on top of the bigger ones (i.e., making a 1/2 out of two 1/4's). This also seems sturdy and the colors are nice and vibrant. Definitely recommend, especially for those interested in math early on or for those having a hard time understanding fractions.",79,65
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,Using these fraction tiles make working with fractions fun and easy.  It is very easy to explain fractions to children with these tiles.,23,66
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,This product was really helpful in teaching my twins fractions.  It is a good visual aid and visual aids are always a good idea for younger kids.,27,67
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"This product does help teach my children their fractions, but the tiles get lost pretty easily. I bought a zippered bag to store them in and I find them on the floor often. We have managed to find all of the pieces, but other people may not be so lucky. I think that the product would be better if the pieces could slide back and forth rather than come off. Overall the product does what is promised and that it teach fractions. Very useful for learning!",86,68
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I, like many others, purchased this for our home school classroom.  We use the Montessori method and this fits perfect with it.  The tiles and frame are a little thinner than I expected(reason for four stars), but with the training of caring for our work materials, I do not see that as a problem.  Ours also came with stickers for making cards as well.  An added bonus and time saver for me, since that was on my to do list already!",81,69
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,THE FRACTION TILE HAS HELPED MY DAUGHTER WITH HER HOMEWORK AND SHE SEEMS TO REALLY LIKE DOING FRACTION PROBLEMS NOW WHICH IS A PLUS.,24,70
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Got this for my 6yo. Great visual tool. Good for a hands on approach often needed to link the mental imagery. Now I'm on the lookout for real world fraction objects, like pizzas, pies and similar.",36,71
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"My 4 year old really enjoys trying to make all the pieces fit into a row....he's not quite ready to understand fractions completely but this is a good introduction for him and it's fun.  The pieces are sturdy and bright and the wiriting on them is clear and concise, easily read.",51,72
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Children can compare fractions easily for their 3rd grade homework assignments.

My only complaint is the set does not contain all of the fractions, only 1 thru 6, 8, 10 & 12.",32,73
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"My high school students enjoy this using this board. It helps them ""see"" what fractions look like and for comparing them.",21,74
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I have been a math teacher from elementary to middle school.  I've seen much more interesting and fun ways to discover fractional parts.  I had bought this for my preschool son hoping it could be fun to put them in rows and talk about them, but bagged that idea early on.  I kept them hoping to pull them out later but I don't know how much use I'll get out of them.  The materials are thin and feel cheap.  The tray is a pitiful plastic and doesn't have a lid.  This makes them all pile up in the box so they are rarely all put away in the tray in a way you could compare them.
This might be fine for a 3rd-5th grader, but is certainly not the first math manipulative I would buy.",135,75
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"It is educational and easy to learn, also comes with bunch of stickers. My kids just love it, and learning fractions with this tool is plain simple.",27,76

Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I grew up with cuisenaire rods, but this is even more helpful for fractions! Purchased to help an 8-year-old who is having difficulty with fractions because her school curriculum changed and her class skipped some foundational material for fractions. She loved these and loved the suggested games.",47,78
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"I got these for my 2nd grade daughter who was being introduced to fractions.  When I try to get them out, she just sighs & says, ""yeah mom, I already know it!""  She finds them boring & is much more interested in more applicable fractions such as cutting a pizza, candy bar, etc.  Also, I found that it has a good many fraction pieces, but when you go to comparing that 1/3 of 6 is 2, it doesn't allow for that computation as there are no 1/6th pieces to compare.  However, with the cuisenaire rods, you can easily compute that 1/3 of six is the rod with 2 cubes.  Anyway, I bought both items at about the same time & have really not used these as the cuisenaire rods seem to do what these do, plus so much more.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learning-Resources-Connecting-Cuisenaire-Rods-Introductory-Set/dp/B000F8T9HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learning Resources Connecting Cuisenaire Rods Introductory Set</a>",148,79
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"The fraction strips are bright, good sized and easy to handle by both students & teachers.  The fractions are easy to read, easy to decipher and easy to handle.  The only thing I would change is the plastic base to something a little sturdier, but the fraction pieces themselves are solid.  Also, the board does have to be handled on a flat surface, to keep the pieces in place.  However, my third grader used the pieces individually on his desk as much as he did sitting neatly in the set, in order to compare and contrast the various sizes.",99,80
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,These strips are a good tool for modeling and finding equivalent fractions. The pieces are colorful and durable. I would also recommend the fraction circles.,25,81
Toys_and_Games,B001604R1G,"Both my 3 and 5 year old love to play with it, and it's fun to learn during play!
the younger kid can play it like a puzzle, no need to put all 1/10 or 1/12 in a row, they can mixed up and just make sure they all end in a 1 in a row.
Great product! for the storage part, you can always use your own ziploc bag.",70,82
